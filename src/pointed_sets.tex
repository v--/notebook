\subsection{Pointed sets}\label{subsec:pointed_sets}

\begin{definition}\label{def:pointed_set}
  The simplest algebraic structure is a \term{pointed set}. It is simply a nonempty set \( \mscrX \) equipped with an distinguished element \( e \in X \). It is an algebraic structure because \( e \) can be regarded as the, sole value of a nullary function \( \odot: X^0 \to X \).

  We will call \( e \) the \term{origin} of \( \mscrX \) based on the terminology for \hyperref[def:euclidean_plane_coordinate_system/origin]{affine coordinate systems}.

  \begin{thmenum}
    \thmitem{def:pointed_set/theory} Pointed sets can also be viewed as \hyperref[def:first_order_semantics/satisfiability]{models} of an \hyperref[def:first_order_theory]{empty theory} for a \hyperref[def:first_order_language]{first-order logic language} consisting of:
    \begin{thmenum}
      \thmitem{def:theory_of_pointed_sets/eq} A formal equality symbol \( \doteq \).
      \thmitem{def:theory_of_pointed_sets/point} A constant, i.e. a nullary \hyperref[def:first_order_language/func]{functional symbol}.
    \end{thmenum}

    This theory is called the theory of pointed sets.

    \thmitem{def:pointed_set/homomorphism} A \hyperref[def:first_order_homomorphism]{homomorphism} (based on \fullref{def:pointed_set/theory}) between the pointed sets \( (\mscrX, e_{\mscrX}) \) and \( (\mscrY, e_{\mscrY}) \) is, explicitly, a function \( \varphi: \mscrX \to \mscrY \) that satisfies
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:def:pointed_set/homomorphism}
      \varphi(e_{\mscrX}) = e_{\mscrY}.
    \end{equation}

    \thmitem{def:pointed_set/submodel} The set \( S \subseteq X \) is a \hyperref[def:first_order_substructure]{substructure} if \( \mscrX \) if \( e \in S \).

    \thmitem{def:pointed_set/category} We denote the \hyperref[def:category_of_small_first_order_models]{category of \( \mscrU \)-small models} for the theory of pointed sets by \( \cat{Set}_* \). We denote the \hyperref[def:category_of_small_first_order_models]{category of \( \mscrU \)-small models} for the theory of pointed sets by \( \cat{Set}_* \).
  \end{thmenum}
