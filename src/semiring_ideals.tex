\subsection{Semiring ideals}\label{subsec:semiring_ideals}

When regarding \hyperref[def:semiring]{semirings} as \hyperref[def:semimodule]{semimodules} over themselves, as per \fullref{thm:semiring_is_semimodule}, we obtain several important notions.

\begin{definition}\label{def:semiring_ideal}\mimprovised
  Fix a semiring \( R \). A \term{left ideal} of \( R \) is a \hyperref[def:semimodule/submodel]{sub-semimodule} of \( R \) when regarded as a left semimodule over itself, and a \term{right ideal} is defined analogously.

  If \( I \) is both a left and right ideal of \( R \), we say that it is a \term{two-sided ideal} or simply \term{ideal}. More explicitly, \( I \) is a two-sided ideal of \( R \) if it is a \hyperref[def:monoid/submodel]{submonoid} of the additive monoid of \( R \) that is closed under left and right multiplication, i.e. \( RI = I = IR \).

  When \hyperref[def:ring/quotient]{quotient rings} are involved, we will have no choice but to work with two-sided ideals. If multiplication is commutative, every left ideal is a right ideal and there is no distinction between the two. Otherwise, we will usually consider left ideals by default. Right ideals are left ideals in the \hyperref[def:semiring/opposite]{opposite semiring}, and thus we lose no generality.

  \begin{thmenum}
    \thmitem{def:semiring_ideal/generated} For an arbitrary subset \( A \) of \( R \), we call the (left) \hyperref[def:semimodule/submodel]{linear span} of \( A \) the left ideal \term{generated} by \( A \). Explicitly, this is the set
    \begin{equation*}
      \sum_{k=1}^n A a_k = \set*{ \sum_{k=1}^n t_k a_k \given \qforall {k \leq n} a_k \in A \T{and} t_k \in R }.
    \end{equation*}

    If \( A = \set{ a_1, \ldots, a_n } \), we instead write
    \begin{equation*}
      A a_1 + \cdots + A a_n.
    \end{equation*}

    For right ideals, this becomes
    \begin{equation*}
      a_1 A + \cdots + a_n A.
    \end{equation*}

    This is discussed in \fullref{thm:generators_via_polynomials} for the case of commutative rings, where we use the notation \( \braket{ A } \). In general rings, we are more explicit for the sake of avoiding possible confusion.

    \thmitem{def:semiring_ideal/principal} An ideal generated by a single element is called a \term{principal ideal}. In a general ring, there can be left, right and two-sided principal ideals.

    \thmitem{def:semiring_ideal/irreducible}\mcite[92]{Golan2010} If \( K \) is a proper ideal and if from \( I \cap J = K \) it follows that \( I = K \) or \( J = K \) (or both), we say that \( K \) is an \term{irreducible ideal}.

    This is unfortunately inconsistent with \hyperref[def:irreducible_element]{irreducible elements}.

    \thmitem{def:semiring_ideal/prime}\mcite[85]{Golan2010} If \( P \) is a proper ideal and if from \( IJ \subseteq P \) it follows that \( I \subseteq P \) or \( J \subseteq P \) (or both), we say that \( P \) is a \term{prime ideal}.

    When working with commutative semirings, \fullref{thm:def:semiring_ideal/properties/prime_pointwise} is instead sometimes taken as the definition of a prime ideal.

    \thmitem{def:semiring_ideal/coprime}\mcite[18]{КоцевСидеров2016} If \( I + J = R \) for proper ideals \( I \) and \( J \), we say that \( I \) and \( J \) are \term{coprime}. Equivalently, \( I \) and \( J \) are coprime if their sum contains the identity.

    \thmitem{def:semiring_ideal/radical}\mcite[15]{КоцевСидеров2016} The \term{radical} of the ideal \( I \) is the ideal
    \begin{equation*}
      \sqrt I \coloneqq \set{ x \in R \given \qexists {n \in \BbbZ_{>0}} x^n \in I }.
    \end{equation*}

    \thmitem{def:semiring_ideal/maximal} A \term{maximal ideal} is a proper ideal that is maximal with respect to set inclusion. The maximal ideals are the predecessors of \( R \) in the lattice of ideals described in \fullref{thm:semiring_of_ideals}.
  \end{thmenum}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\label{rem:semiring_ideal_as_sub_semiring}
  A proper semiring ideal is a canonical example of a non-unital sub-semiring. As a consequence of \fullref{thm:def:semiring_ideal/properties/proper_ideals_containing_identity}, a proper ideal cannot contain the multiplicative identity \( 1 \), and is thus not a sub-semiring unless we allow sub-semirings to not contain \( 1 \).
\end{remark}

\begin{proposition}\label{thm:def:semiring_ideal/properties}
  The left \hyperref[def:semiring_ideal]{ideals} of a semiring \( R \) have the following basic properties:
  \begin{thmenum}[series=thm:def:semiring_ideal/properties]
    \thmitem{thm:def:semiring_ideal/properties/proper_ideals_containing_identity} An ideal contains the multiplicative identity if and only if it is not proper. In particular, \( R = \braket{ 1_R } \).

    \thmitem{thm:def:semiring_ideal/properties/division} We have \( Rx \subseteq Ry \) if and only if \( y \) is a right divisor of \( x \). Note how \( Rx \) and \( Ry \) are \hi{left} principal ideals but \( y \) is a \hi{right} divisor.

    For commutative semirings, this reduces to \( \braket{ x } \subseteq \braket{ y } \) if and only if \( y \mid x \).

    \thmitem{thm:def:semiring_ideal/properties/prime_is_irreducible} Every \hyperref[def:semiring_ideal/maximal]{prime ideal} is \hyperref[def:semiring_ideal/irreducible]{irreducible}.

    \Fullref{thm:ufd_prime_iff_irreducible} is a converse that holds for \hyperref[def:unique_factorization_domain]{unique factorization domains}.

    This is comparable to but different from \fullref{thm:def:semiring_primality/properties/prime_is_irreducible}.

    \thmitem{thm:def:semiring_ideal/properties/maximal_is_prime} Every \hyperref[def:semiring_ideal/maximal]{maximal ideal} is \hyperref[def:semiring_ideal/prime]{prime}.

    \Fullref{thm:prime_ideals_are_maximal_in_pid} is a converse that holds for \hyperref[def:principal_ideal_domain]{principal ideal domains}.

    \thmitem{thm:def:semiring_ideal/properties/coprime_product} We have \( IJ \subseteq I \cap J \). The converse inclusion holds if \( R \) is \hyperref[def:semiring/commutative]{commutative} and if \( I \) and \( J \) are \hyperref[def:semiring_ideal/coprime]{coprime}.

    \thmitem{thm:def:semiring_ideal/properties/nilradical} The \hyperref[def:semiring_ideal/radical]{radical} \( \sqrt {\braket{ 0 }} \) of the zero ideal is the intersection of all prime ideals. We call it the \term{nilradical} of the semiring, and we call elements of \( \sqrt{\braket{ 0 }} \) \term{nilpotent elements}.
  \end{thmenum}

  The following require \( R \) to be \hyperref[def:semiring/commutative]{commutative}:
  \begin{thmenum}[series=thm:def:semiring_ideal/properties]
    \thmitem{thm:def:semiring_ideal/properties/principal_ideal_equality} We have \( \braket{ x } = \braket{ y } \) if and only if \( x \) and \( y \) are \hyperref[def:divisibility/associates]{associates}.

    \thmitem{thm:def:semiring_ideal/properties/product_of_principal_ideals} The product of the principal ideals \( \braket{x} \) and \( \braket{y} \) is \( \braket{xy} \).

    \thmitem{thm:def:semiring_ideal/properties/prime_pointwise} In a commutative semiring, an equivalent condition to \( P \) being \hyperref[def:semiring_ideal/prime]{prime} is that \( xy \in P \) implies \( x \in P \) or \( y \in P \) (or both).

    \thmitem{thm:def:semiring_ideal/properties/prime_is_radical} Every \hyperref[def:semiring_ideal/prime]{prime ideal} in a commutative semirings is \hyperref[def:semiring_ideal/radical]{radical}.
  \end{thmenum}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  \SubProofOf{thm:def:semiring_ideal/properties/proper_ideals_containing_identity} We will prove that \( 1 \in I \) if and only if \( I = R \).

  \SufficiencySubProof* Let \( 1 \in I \). Then \( 1x = x \) for any \( x \in R \), thus \( IR = R \). But \( I \) is an ideal, hence we have that \( IR = I \). Therefore, \( I = IR = R \).

  \NecessitySubProof* If \( I = R \), then obviously \( 1 \in I \).

  An analogous proof follows for the case when \( I \) is a right ideal.

  \SubProofOf{thm:def:semiring_ideal/properties/division}

  \SufficiencySubProof* Suppose that \( Rx \subseteq Ry \). Then \( x \in Ry \), and hence there exists an element \( l \) of \( R \) such that \( x = ly \). So \( y \) is a right divisor of \( x \).

  \NecessitySubProof* Suppose that \( y \) is a right divisor of \( x \). Then there exists an element \( l \) of \( R \) such that \( x = ly \). Thus, \( x \in Ry \), and hence \( Rx \subseteq Ry \).

  \SubProofOf{thm:def:semiring_ideal/properties/prime_is_irreducible} Let \( P \) be a prime ideal and let \( P = I \cap J \). By \fullref{thm:def:semiring_ideal/properties/coprime_product}, \( IJ \subseteq P \), and thus either \( I \subseteq P \) or \( J \subseteq P \).

  Therefore, either \( P = I \) or \( P = J \), which shows that \( P \) is irreducible.

  \SubProofOf{thm:def:semiring_ideal/properties/maximal_is_prime} Let \( M \) be a maximal ideal and let \( IJ \subseteq M \). Since \( M \) is maximal, \( M \subseteq M + I \subseteq R \), and at least one of the inclusion is an equality. Suppose that \( M + I = R \), i.e. \( M \) and \( I \) are \hyperref[def:semiring_ideal/coprime]{coprime} ideals. Then, by the right distributivity in the \hyperref[thm:semiring_of_ideals/lattice]{semiring of ideals} of \( R \), we have
  \begin{equation*}
    J = RJ = (M + I)J = MJ + IJ \subseteq M + IJ = M.
  \end{equation*}

  Similarly, if \( M \) and \( J \) are coprime, then by left distributivity,
  \begin{equation*}
    I = IR = I(M + J) = IM + IJ \subseteq M + IJ = M.
  \end{equation*}

  \SubProofOf{thm:def:semiring_ideal/properties/coprime_product} We will first show that \( IJ \subseteq I \cap J \). If \( xy \in IJ \), then \( xy \in xJ = J \) and \( xy \in Iy = I \), hence \( xy \in I \cap J \).

  Now suppose that \( R \) is commutative and that \( I \) and \( J \) are coprime. Then there exist \( i \in I \) and \( j \in J \) such that \( i + j = 1_R \). For every \( x \in I \cap J \), we have \( ix \in IJ \) and \( xj \in IJ \). Therefore,
  \begin{equation*}
    ix + xj = (i + j)x = x.
  \end{equation*}

  \SubProofOf{thm:def:semiring_ideal/properties/nilradical}
  \SufficiencySubProof* Let \( x \in \sqrt{\braket{0}} \). That is, there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( x^n = 0 \). Let \( P \) be a prime ideal. We will show that \( x \in P \).

  Note that \( 0 \) necessarily belongs to \( P \). Since it is prime, either \( x^{n-1} \in P \) or \( x \in P \). If \( x^{n-1} \in P \), then either \( x^{n-2} \in P \) or \( x \in P \). Proceeding by induction on \( k \) in \( x^{n-k} \), we obtain that \( x \in P \).

  \NecessitySubProof* Conversely, let \( x \) be a member of every prime ideal. Suppose that \( x^n \neq 0 \) for every \( n \). Consider the following family of ideals:
  \begin{equation*}
    \mscrH \coloneqq \set{ I \T{is an ideal of} R \given \qforall {n \in \BbbZ_{>0}} x^n \not\in I }.
  \end{equation*}

  It is nonempty because \( \braket{0} \in \mscrH \).

  For every chain of ideals in \( \mscrH \), their union is also an ideal in \( \mscrH \). By \fullref{thm:zorns_lemma}, \( \mscrH \) has a maximal element \( H \). We will show that \( H \) is prime. From \( IJ \subseteq H \) it follows that \( IJ \in \mscrH \). If we suppose that neither \( I \) nor \( J \) belongs to \( \mscrH \), we obtain that there exist positive integers \( n_i \) and \( n_j \) such that \( x^{n_i} \in I \) and \( x^{n_j} \in J \). But \( x^{n_i + n_j} \) must then belong to \( IJ \), which contradicts \( IJ \in \mscrH \). The obtained contradiction demonstrates that \( H \) is a prime ideal. But this is impossible since, by assumption \( x \) is contained in every prime ideal, and \( x \not\in H \). So this must contradict our previous assumption that \( x^n \neq 0 \) for every \( n \).

  Therefore, \( x \) belongs to \( \sqrt{\braket{0}} \).

  \SubProofOf{thm:def:semiring_ideal/properties/principal_ideal_equality} Follows from \fullref{thm:def:semiring_ideal/properties/division}.

  \SubProofOf{thm:def:semiring_ideal/properties/product_of_principal_ideals}\hfill
  \SufficiencySubProof* Let \( z \in \braket{x} \braket{y} \). Then there exist elements \( x_z \) of \( \braket{x} \) and \( y_z \) of \( \braket{y} \) such that \( z = x_z y_z \), and elements \( r_x \) and \( r_y \) of \( R \) such that \( x r_x = x_z \) and \( y r_y = y_z \).

  Therefore,
  \begin{equation*}
    z = \underbrace{(x r_x) (y r_y)}_{(xy) (r_x r_y)} \in \braket{xy}.
  \end{equation*}

  \NecessitySubProof* Let \( z \in \braket{xy} \). Then there exists an element \( r \) of \( R \) such that \( z = rxy = (rx)(y) \), hence \( z \in \braket{x} \braket{y} \).

  \SubProofOf{thm:def:semiring_ideal/properties/prime_pointwise} Suppose that \( R \) is commutative.
  \SufficiencySubProof* Let \( P \) be prime and let \( xy \in P \). Then \( \braket{xy} \subseteq P \). By \fullref{thm:def:semiring_ideal/properties/product_of_principal_ideals}, \( \braket{x} \braket{y} \subseteq P \), and hence either \( \braket{x} \subseteq P \) or \( \braket{y} \subseteq P \). Therefore, either \( x \in P \) or \( y \in P \).

  \NecessitySubProof* Let \( P \) be an ideal such that \( xy \in P \) implies \( x \in P \) or \( y \in P \). Let \( IJ \subseteq P \) and suppose that there exist \( i \in I \setminus P \) and \( j \in J \setminus P \).

  Obviously \( ij \in I \). But since \( P \) is prime, it follows that either \( i \in P \) or \( j \in P \).

  The obtained contradiction shows that either \( I \) or \( J \) must be a subset of \( P \). Therefore, \( P \) is prime.

  \SubProofOf{thm:def:semiring_ideal/properties/prime_is_radical} Suppose that \( R \) is commutative, let \( P \) be a prime ideal and let \( x^n \in P \) for \( n > 0 \). We will show that \( x \in P \).

  We proceed via induction on \( n \). The case \( n = 1 \) is trivial. Suppose that \( x^{n-1} \in P \) implies \( x \in P \), and let \( x = x \cdot x^{n-1} \in P \). Since \( P \) is prime and \( R \) is commutative, by \fullref{thm:def:semiring_ideal/properties/prime_pointwise}, either \( x \in P \) or \( x^{n-1} \in P \). In the latter case, we use the inductive hypothesis to show that \( x \in P \).

  Generalizing on \( x \), we conclude that \( P \) is a radical ideal.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{thm:semiring_of_ideals}
  \hfill
  \begin{thmenum}
    \thmitem{thm:semiring_of_ideals/semiring} The set \( \mscrI \) of all ideals of a semiring \( R \) is itself a semiring with the set addition and multiplication from \hyperref[def:semiring/power_set]{power set semiring} \( \pow(R) \).

    \thmitem{thm:semiring_of_ideals/order} Furthermore, \( \mscrI \) is an \hyperref[def:ordered_semiring]{ordered semiring} with respect to set inclusion.

    \thmitem{thm:semiring_of_ideals/lattice} The \hyperref[def:partially_ordered_set_extremal_points/supremum_and_infimum]{supremum} of \( I \) and \( J \) is their sum \( I + J \) and their \hyperref[def:partially_ordered_set_extremal_points/supremum_and_infimum]{infimum} is their intersection \( I \cap J \). With this, \( \mscrI \) becomes a lattice.
  \end{thmenum}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  \SubProofOf{thm:semiring_of_ideals/semiring} Associativity and commutativity in \( \mscrI \) are inherited from \( R \), as well as both left and right distributivity. Distributivity ensures that \( I + J \) is an ideal, while associativity of multiplication ensures that \( IJ \) is an ideal.

  \SubProofOf{thm:semiring_of_ideals/order} We must now prove that the partial order \( \subseteq \) is compatible with addition and multiplication. Suppose that \( I \subseteq J \) and let \( H \) be any ideal in \( \mscrI \). Then
  \begin{equation*}
    I + H \subseteq J + H
  \end{equation*}
  and
  \begin{equation*}
    IH \subseteq IH.
  \end{equation*}

  Therefore, \( \mscrI \) is an ordered semiring.

  \SubProofOf{thm:semiring_of_ideals/lattice} Since \( 0 \in I \), obviously \( I \subseteq I + J \), and thus \( I + J \) is an upper bound of \( I \) and \( J \). If \( H \) is any other upper bound, it must contain the sums of all elements of \( I \) and all elements of \( J \), hence \( I + J \subseteq H \). Therefore, \( \sup\set{I, J} = I + J \).

  For \( I \cap J \), it is an infimum of \( I \) and \( J \) as a consequence of \fullref{thm:boolean_algebra_of_subsets/meet}.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}\label{def:gcd_and_lcm}\mimprovised
  Let \( R \) be an \hyperref[def:entire_semiring]{entire} \hyperref[def:semiring/commutative]{commutative semiring}. The ideal
  \begin{equation*}
    \sup\set{ \braket{x}, \braket{y} } = \braket{x} + \braket{y}
  \end{equation*}
  contains the common divisors of \( x \) and \( y \). If this ideal has some canonical representative \( z \), we call \( z \) the \term{greatest common divisor} of \( x \) and \( y \) and write \( z = \gcd(x, y) \). This canonical representative must be defined specifically for each semiring, but it is necessary to guarantee uniqueness.

  Dually, if
  \begin{equation*}
    \inf\set{ \braket{x}, \braket{y} } = \braket{x} \cap \braket{y}
  \end{equation*}
  has some canonical representative \( z \), we call \( z \) the \term{least common multiple} of \( x \) and \( y \) and write \( z = \lcm(x, y) \).
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}\label{thm:natural_number_divisibility_order}
  The set \hyperref[def:set_of_natural_numbers]{\( \BbbN \)} of natural numbers is a \hyperref[def:semilattice/bounded]{bounded lattice} with respect to \hyperref[def:divisibility]{semiring divisibility}. Explicitly:
  \begin{thmenum}
    \thmitem{thm:natural_number_divisibility_order/join} The \hyperref[def:semilattice/join]{join} of \( n \) and \( m \) is their \hyperref[def:gcd_and_lcm]{least common multiple} \( \lcm(n, m) \). Well-ordering allows us to pick the smallest from all common multiple.

    \thmitem{thm:natural_number_divisibility_order/bottom} The \hyperref[def:partially_ordered_set_extremal_points/top_and_bottom]{bottom element} element is \( 1 \) since \( 1 \) divides every natural number.

    \thmitem{thm:natural_number_divisibility_order/meet} Dually, the \hyperref[def:semilattice/meet]{meet} of \( n \) and \( m \) is their \hyperref[def:gcd_and_lcm]{greatest common divisor} \( \gcd(n, m) \).

    \thmitem{thm:natural_number_divisibility_order/top} The \hyperref[def:partially_ordered_set_extremal_points/top_and_bottom]{top element} is \( 0 \) since every natural number divides \( 0 \).
  \end{thmenum}

  Furthermore, divisibility is compatible with the standard ordering in the sense that \( n \mid m \) implies \( n \leq m \).

  \end{figure}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  By \fullref{thm:semiring_divisibility_order}, divisibility is a preorder.

  \SubProofOf[def:binary_relation/antisymmetric]{antisymmetry} If \( n \mid m \) and \( m \mid n \), there exist numbers \( a \) and \( b \) such that \( n = ay \) and \( m = bx \). Then \( n = abx \), and we can cancel \( n \) to obtain that \( ab = 1 \). But \( 1 \) is the only unit in \( \BbbN \), hence \( a = b = 1 \), and thus \( n = m \).

  \SubProofOf[def:semilattice/lattice]{lattice structure} By \fullref{alg:euclidean_algorithm}, every pair of integers has a positive greatest common divisor, and also a least common multiple.

  By \fullref{thm:def:semiring_ideal/properties/division}, the lattice of principal ideals in \( \BbbN \) must be dual to it. Indeed, by \fullref{thm:bezout_identity}, we have that
  \begin{equation*}
    \braket{n} + \braket{m} = \braket{ \gcd(n, m) },
  \end{equation*}
  and by \fullref{thm:def:semiring_ideal/properties/division}, \( \braket{n} \cap \braket{m} \) contains the common multiples of \( n \) and \( m \), hence
  \begin{equation*}
    \braket{n} \cap \braket{m} = \braket{ \lcm(n, m) }.
  \end{equation*}

  \SubProof{Proof that the order are compatible} If \( n \mid m \), then there exists a positive natural number \( a \) such that \( an = m \). We have
  \begin{equation*}
    an
    \reloset{\eqref{eq:def:peano_arithmetic/PA7}} =
    (a - 1)n + n
    =
    m.
  \end{equation*}

  Thus, by \eqref{eq:def:natural_number_ordering/predicate}, \( n \leq m \).
\end{proof}

\begin{example}\label{ex:def:semiring_ideal}
  We list several examples of \hyperref[def:semiring_ideal]{semiring ideals}.
  \begin{thmenum}
    \thmitem{ex:def:semiring_ideal/matrices} Consider the matrix algebra \( \BbbZ^{2 \times 2} \). The set
    \begin{equation*}
      \set[\Bigg]
      {
        \begin{pmatrix}
          0 & a \\
          0 & b
        \end{pmatrix}
        \given*
        a, b \in \BbbZ
      }.
    \end{equation*}
    is a left ideal. It is not a right ideal, however, because
    \begin{equation*}
      \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 0 \\
        1 & 0
      \end{pmatrix}
      \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & 1 \\
        0 & 1
      \end{pmatrix}
      =

        0 & 1 \\

    \thmitem{ex:def:semiring_ideal/polynomial_ideals} Consider the bivariate \hyperref[def:polynomial_semiring]{polynomial semiring} \( \BbbN[X, Y] \) over natural numbers. Since \( (X + Y)^2 = X^2 + 2XY + Y^2 \), we have
    \begin{equation*}
      \braket{ X^2 + 2XY + Y^2 } \subseteq \braket{ X + Y }.
    \end{equation*}

    \thmitem{ex:def:semiring_ideal/ideal_polynomials} Ideals in polynomial (semi)rings are often studied, but we can also study polynomials in ideal semirings, i.e. polynomials over the semiring \( \mscrI \) of ideals of a semiring \( R \). For example,
    \begin{equation*}
      I^2 J + K
    \end{equation*}
    is a trivariate polynomial function over \( \mscrI \).

    \thmitem{ex:def:semiring_ideal/prime_not_maximal} The zero ideal \( \braket{ 0 } \) in \( \BbbN \) is \hyperref[def:semiring_ideal/prime]{prime} but not \hyperref[def:semiring_ideal/maximal]{maximal}.

    Indeed, since \( \BbbN \) is entire, \( \braket{ 0 } = \set{ 0 } \) and thus \( \braket{ 0 } \) is prime. But it is not maximal since it is contained in every other ideal.

    \thmitem{ex:def:semiring_ideal/natural_numbers_principal_ideals} For natural numbers, \( \braket{ n } = \braket{ m } \) implies \( n = m \). Indeed, by \fullref{thm:def:semiring_ideal/properties/principal_ideal_equality}, \( n \) and \( m \) are \hyperref[def:divisibility/associates]{associates}, and by \fullref{thm:associates_in_entire_semirings}, there exists a unit \( u \) such that \( n = um \). But \( 1 \) is the only unit in \( \BbbN \), hence \( n = m \).

    \thmitem{ex:def:semiring_ideal/prime_numbers} A natural number \( n \) is \hyperref[def:prime_number]{prime} if and only if \( \braket{n} \) is a \hyperref[def:semiring_ideal/prime]{prime ideal} in \( \BbbN \).

    Suppose that \( n \) is prime and let \( n \mid mk \). From \fullref{thm:euclids_lemma} it follows that either \( n \mid k \) or \( n \mid m \), hence \fullref{thm:def:semiring_ideal/properties/prime_pointwise} is satisfied and \( \braket{ n } \) is a prime ideal.

    In the other direction, suppose that \( \braket{ n } \) is a prime ideal and let \( n = ab \). By \fullref{thm:def:semiring_ideal/properties/product_of_principal_ideals}, \( \braket{ n } = \braket{ a } \braket{ b } \). Since \( \braket{ n } \) is a prime ideal, either \( \braket{ a } \subseteq \braket{ n } \) or \( \braket{ b } \subseteq \braket{ n } \).

    Therefore, either \( \braket{ n } = \braket{ a } \) or \( \braket{ n } = \braket{ b } \). By \fullref{ex:def:semiring_ideal/natural_numbers_principal_ideals}, \( n = a \) or \( n = b \), which in turn implies that the other is a unit.

    Therefore, \( n \) is a prime number.

    \thmitem{ex:def:semiring_ideal/maximal_induced_coprime} If \( M \) is a maximal ideal and \( x \in R \setminus M \), then \( M \) and \( \braket{ x } \) are \hyperref[def:semiring_ideal/coprime]{coprime}.

\begin{theorem}[Maximal ideal theorem]\label{thm:maximal_ideal_theorem}\mcite[prop. 6.59]{Golan2010}
  Every proper \hyperref[def:semiring_ideal]{semiring ideal} is contained in a \hyperref[def:semiring_ideal/maximal]{maximal ideal}.

  Within \hyperref[def:zfc]{\logic{ZF}}, this theorem is equivalent to the \hyperref[def:zfc/choice]{axiom of choice} --- see \fullref{thm:axiom_of_choice_equivalences/maximal_ideal}.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  We will show equivalence with \fullref{thm:zorns_lemma}.

  \ImplicationSubProof[thm:zorns_lemma]{Zorn's lemma}[thm:existence_of_multi_valued_function_selection]{maximal ideal theorem} Let \( I \) be a proper ideal in the semiring \( R \). Denote by \( \mscrM \) the set of all proper ideals in \( R \) that contain \( I \). The union of every chain in \( \mscrM \) is again an ideal, and by Zorn's lemma, \( \mscrM \) has a maximal element. That is, there exists a maximal ideal in \( \mscrM \) that contains \( I \).

  \ImplicationSubProof[thm:existence_of_multi_valued_function_selection]{maximal ideal theorem}[thm:zorns_lemma]{Zorn's lemma} In \cite{Hodges1979}, Hodges proves that the statement \enquote{every \hyperref[def:unique_factorization_domain]{unique factorization domain} has a maximal ideal} implies Zorn's lemma. We have an even stronger antecedent.
