\subsection{Semirings}\label{subsec:semirings}

We will start by defining semirings, and to do that we will first motivate distributivity.

\begin{proposition}\label{thm:monoid_distributivity}
  Fix a \hyperref[def:magma/commutative]{commutative} \hyperref[def:monoid]{monoid} \( (R, +, \cdot) \), where \( +: R \times R \to R \) is the monoid operation and \( \cdot: \BbbN \times R \to R \) is \hyperref[rem:additive_magma/multiplication]{recursively defined multiplication}.

  We have the following property, which we call \term{distributivity} of \( \cdot \) over \( + \):
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:thm:monoid_distributivity}
    n \cdot (x + y) = n \cdot x + n \cdot y.
  \end{equation}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  We use induction on \( n \). The case \( n = 0 \) is trivial. Suppose that \eqref{eq:thm:monoid_distributivity} holds. Then
  \begin{equation*}
    (n + 1) \cdot (x + y)
    \reloset {\eqref{eq:def:magma/exponentiation}} =
    n \cdot (x + y) + (x + y)
    \reloset {\T{ind.}} =
    n \cdot x + n \cdot y + (x + y)
    \reloset {\eqref{eq:def:magma/exponentiation}} =
    (n + 1) \cdot x + (n + 1) \cdot y.
  \end{equation*}
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}\label{def:semiring}\mcite[1]{Golan2010}
  A \term{semiring} is a \hyperref[def:magma/commutative]{commutative} \hyperref[def:monoid]{monoid} \( (R, +) \) with a second \hyperref[def:magma/associative]{associative} operation \( \cdot: R \times R \to R \) called \term{multiplication}, which extends multiplication with natural numbers. The precise compatibility axioms are listed in \fullref{def:semiring/theory} because they fit nicely into first-order logic (unlike the \hyperref[def:semimodule/theory]{theory of semimodules}, for example, for which we prefer expressing these conditions in the metalogic).

  Although not strictly necessary, it will be convenient for us to assume that multiplication has an identity. If a multiplicative identity does not exist, we call \( (R, +, \cdot) \) a \term{nonunital semiring}. We will not use nonunital semirings, but it is important to acknowledge their existence. In this context, if an identity exists, we will sometimes call \( (R, + \cdot) \) a \term{unital semiring}.

  We call \( (R, +) \) the \term{additive monoid} and \( (R, \cdot) \) the \term{multiplicative monoid} of the semiring.

  Semirings have the following metamathematical properties:
  \begin{thmenum}
    \thmitem{def:semiring/theory} The \hyperref[def:first_order_theory]{first-order theory} for semirings extends the \hyperref[def:monoid/theory]{theory of monoids}.

    First, we add another \hyperref[rem:first_order_formula_conventions/infix]{infix} binary functional symbol \( \cdot \) and a constant \( 1 \). This notation is justified by \fullref{thm:semiring_characteristic_homomorphism}.

    We then extend the theory of monoids with \hyperref[def:magma/commutative]{commutativity} for \( + \), \hyperref[def:magma/associative]{associativity} for \( \cdot \), and the following axioms:
    \begin{thmenum}
      \thmitem{def:semiring/left_distributivity} Multiplication on the left distributes over addition:
      \begin{equation}\label{eq:def:semiring/left_distributivity}
        \xi \cdot (\eta + \zeta) \doteq \xi \cdot \eta + \xi \cdot \zeta.
      \end{equation}

      \thmitem{def:semiring/right_distributivity} Multiplication on the right also distributes over addition:
      \begin{equation}\label{eq:def:semiring/right_distributivity}
        (\xi + \eta) \cdot \zeta \doteq \xi \cdot \zeta + \eta \cdot \zeta.
      \end{equation}

      If multiplication is commutative, right distributivity follows from left distributivity.

      \thmitem{def:semiring/absorption} Zero is an absorbing element:
      \begin{equation}\label{eq:def:semiring/absorption}
        \xi \cdot 0 \doteq 0 \wedge 0 \cdot \xi \doteq 0.
      \end{equation}

      \thmitem{def:semiring/identity} We also restate the identity axiom \eqref{eq:def:monoid/theory/identity} for the multiplicative unit \( 1 \) to highlight its connection with \eqref{eq:def:semiring/absorption}:
      \begin{equation}\label{eq:def:semiring/identity}
        \xi \cdot 1 \doteq \xi \wedge 1 \cdot \xi \doteq \xi.
      \end{equation}
    \end{thmenum}

    \thmitem{def:semiring/homomorphism} A \hyperref[def:first_order_homomorphism]{first-order homomorphism} between the semirings \( R \) and \( S \) is a function \( \varphi: R \to S \) that is a \hyperref[def:monoid/homomorphism]{monoid homomorphism} both for their additive monoids also for their multiplicative monoids.

    \thmitem{def:semiring/submodel} The set \( S \subseteq R \) is a \hyperref[thm:substructure_is_model]{submodel} of \( R \) if it is a both \hyperref[def:monoid/submodel]{submonoid} of the additive monoid and also of the multiplicative monoid.

    As a consequence of \fullref{thm:positive_formulas_preserved_under_homomorphism}, the \hyperref[def:multi_valued_function/image]{image} of a semiring homomorphism \( \varphi: R \to S \) is a sub-semiring of \( S \).

    For an arbitrary set \( S \), we denote the \hyperref[def:first_order_generated_substructure]{generated submodel} by \( \braket{ S } \).

    \thmitem{def:semiring/trivial} The \hyperref[thm:substructures_form_complete_lattice/bottom]{trivial} semiring is the \hyperref[def:pointed_set/trivial]{trivial pointed set} \( \set{ 0 } \).

    See \fullref{ex:def:semiring/trivial} for some properties of the trivial semiring.

    \thmitem{def:semiring/category} The \hyperref[def:category_of_small_first_order_models]{category of \( \mscrU \)-small models} \( \ucat{SRing} \) is \hyperref[def:concrete_category]{concrete} over \hyperref[def:monoid]{\( \ucat{CMon} \)} with the forgetful functor taking the additive monoids.

    \thmitem{def:semiring/exponentiation} As we shall see in \fullref{thm:semiring_characteristic_homomorphism}, multiplication in \( \cdot \) extends multiplication by natural numbers in the abelian group \( (R, +) \). We do have a third operation, however --- \hyperref[def:monoid/exponentiation]{monoid exponentiation} in \( (R, \cdot) \).

    For any integer \( n \), we have the fundamental property \( 1^n = 1 \).

    \thmitem{def:semiring/commutative} If multiplication is commutative, we call the semiring itself \term{commutative}. Unless multiplication corresponds to function composition, most semirings we will encounter will be commutative.

    Notable exceptions to this rule are \hyperref[def:ordinal]{ordinals}. An ordinal \( \alpha \), regarded as the set of all smaller ordinals, is a semiring. It is not commutative, however, as shown in \fullref{ex:ordinal_addition}.
  \end{thmenum}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}\label{ex:def:semiring}
  We list several examples of \hyperref[def:semiring]{semirings} that are not rings.

  \begin{thmenum}
    \thmitem{ex:def:semiring/trivial} A \hyperref[def:semiring/homomorphism]{semiring} is trivial if and only if \( 0_R = 1_R \). This follows from \eqref{eq:def:semiring/absorption} and \eqref{eq:def:semiring/identity}.

    As a consequence, if \( \varphi: \set{ 0 } \to R \) is a \hyperref[def:semiring/homomorphism]{semiring} homomorphism, \( R \) is a trivial semiring. This is further strengthened by \fullref{thm:semiring_embedding_preserves_characterstic}.

    \thmitem{ex:def:semiring/natural_numbers} The \hyperref[def:set_of_natural_numbers]{natural numbers} are the quintessential example of a semiring. We prove in \fullref{thm:natural_number_multiplication_properties} that they are a semiring.

    \thmitem{ex:def:semiring/ordinals} Every \hyperref[def:ordinal]{ordinal} is a monoid under addition, as discussed in \fullref{ex:def:semiring/ordinals}, however it is not commutative.

    \hyperref[def:cardinal_arithmetic/addition]{Cardinal addition} is commutative, however, and hence for every \hyperref[def:successor_and_limit_cardinal/weak_limit]{limit cardinal} \( \kappa \), the set of all cardinals smaller than \( \kappa \) are a semiring.

    \thmitem{ex:def:semiring/tropical}\mcite[exmpl. 1.12]{Golan2010} We will consider again the set of natural numbers \( \BbbN \), but this time endowed with different operations. The construction requires adjoining a new element \( \infty \) to \( \BbbN \). We choose this to be the smallest infinite cardinal \hyperref[def:aleph_hierarchy]{\( \aleph_0 \)} because \hyperref[def:cardinal_arithmetic/addition]{cardinal addition} is a well-defined operation that suits our needs.

    The \term{tropical semiring} is the triple \( (\BbbN \cup \set{ \infty }, \min, +) \). The \hyperref[def:partially_ordered_set_extremal_points/maximum_and_minimum]{minimum} \( \min \) as a binary operation plays the role of semilattice addition, with \( \infty \) as the identity. Cardinal addition plays the role of semiring multiplication, with \( 0 \) as the identity.

    \hyperref[def:semiring/left_distributivity]{Distributivity} is satisfied because
    \begin{equation*}
      \min\set{ x, y } + z = \min\set{ x + z , y + z }.
    \end{equation*}

    \hyperref[def:semiring/absorption]{Absorption} is satisfied because \( x + \infty = \infty \) by \fullref{thm:simplified_cardinal_arithmetic/infinite}.
  \end{thmenum}
\end{example}

\begin{proposition}\label{thm:semiring_characteristic_homomorphism}
  For every \hyperref[def:semiring/identity]{semiring}, multiplication extends the abelian group multiplication.

  More precisely, denote the additive identity by \( 0_R \) and the multiplicative identity by \( 1_R \). Define the following semiring homomorphism:
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:thm:semiring_characteristic_homomorphism}
    \begin{aligned}
      &\iota: \BbbN \to R \\
      &\iota(n) \coloneqq \begin{cases}
        0_R                &n = 0, \\
        \iota(n - 1) + 1_R &n > 0.
      \end{cases}
    \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}

  This is the unique homomorphism from \( \BbbN \) to \( R \). Furthermore, we have the following analogue to \eqref{eq:def:magma/exponentiation}:
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:thm:semiring_characteristic_homomorphism/multiplication}
    \iota(n) \cdot x \coloneqq \begin{cases}
      0_R,                      &n = 0, \\
      \iota(n - 1) \cdot x + x, &n > 1.
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  First note that \eqref{eq:thm:semiring_characteristic_homomorphism/multiplication} follows from \eqref{eq:thm:semiring_characteristic_homomorphism} via \hyperref[def:semiring/right_distributivity]{right distributivity}.

  It remains to show that \( \iota \) is a monoid homomorphism, and that it is unique. Clearly \( \iota(0) = 0_R \) and \( \iota(1) = 1_R \). Proving \( \iota(n + m) = \iota(n) + \iota(m) \) and \( \iota(nm) = \iota(n) \cdot \iota(m) \) can be done via nested induction.

  Now suppose \( \varphi: \BbbN \to R \) is a homomorphism. It is clear that \( \varphi(0) = 0_R \) and \( \varphi(1) = 1_R \), and also
  \begin{equation*}
    \varphi(n + 1) = \varphi(n) + \varphi(1) = \varphi(n) + 1_R.
  \end{equation*}

  This implies \( \iota = \varphi \).
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}\label{def:semiring_characteristic}\mimprovised
  We define the \term{characteristic} \( \op{char}(R) \) of a semiring \( R \) via the following equivalent definitions:
  \begin{thmenum}
    \thmitem{def:semiring_characteristic/homomorphism} \( \op{char}(R) \) is the nonnegative integer \( n \) such that
    \begin{equation*}
      n \BbbZ = \ker\iota,
    \end{equation*}
    where \( \iota \) is the homomorphism from the natural numbers defined via \eqref{eq:thm:semiring_characteristic_homomorphism}.

    \thmitem{def:semiring_characteristic/direct} \( \op{char}(R) \) is the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( n \cdot 1_R = 0_R \) and \( \op{char}(R) = 0 \) if \( 0_R \) cannot be obtained in this way.
  \end{thmenum}
\end{definition}
\begin{defproof}
  \EquivalenceSubProof{def:semiring_characteristic/homomorphism}{def:semiring_characteristic/direct} Let \( n \) be such that
  \begin{equation*}
    n \BbbZ = \ker\iota.
  \end{equation*}

  In particular, \( \iota(0) = \iota(n) \).

  If \( n = 0 \), \( \ker\iota \) is a trivial group and \( \iota \) is an embedding. Then there cannot exist a positive integer \( n \) such that
  \begin{equation*}
    n \cdot 1_R = 0_R.
  \end{equation*}

  Otherwise, \( n \) is the smallest positive integer such that
  \begin{equation*}
    n \cdot 1_R = 0 \cdot 1_R = 0_R.
  \end{equation*}
\end{defproof}

\begin{proposition}\label{thm:semiring_embedding_preserves_characterstic}
  If \( \varphi: R \to T \) is a \hyperref[def:semiring/homomorphism]{semiring embedding}, then the \hyperref[def:semiring_characteristic]{characteristic} of \( R \) is equal to that of \( T \).
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  First suppose that \( R \) has positive characteristic \( n \). Then \( n \cdot 1_R = 0_R \), which implies \( n \cdot \varphi(1_R) = \varphi(0_R) \), hence \( \op{char}(T) \leq n \). But \( \varphi \) is an embedding, hence if \( k \cdot 1_R \neq 0_R \), then
  \begin{equation*}
    k \cdot \varphi(1_R) \neq \varphi(0_R).
  \end{equation*}

  This implies that \( \op{char}(T) \geq \op{char}(R) \), which in turn shows that \( \op{char}(T) = \op{char}(R) \).

  If \( R \) has characteristic zero, then \( \iota: \BbbN \to R \) is an embedding and thus \( \varphi \bincirc \iota: \BbbN \to T \) is also an embedding. It is unique as shown in \fullref{thm:semiring_characteristic_homomorphism}. Therefore, \( T \) also has characteristic zero.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}\label{ex:semiring_characteristic}
  The following are examples of \hyperref[def:semiring_characteristic]{semiring characteristics}:

  \begin{thmenum}
    \thmitem{ex:semiring_characteristic/nonnegative_integers} The zero-based \hyperref[def:set_of_natural_numbers]{natural numbers} \( \BbbN \) have characteristic \( \op{char}(\BbbN) = 0 \) because \( \iota \) is an isomorphism. Consequently, by \fullref{thm:semiring_embedding_preserves_characterstic}, any super-semiring of \( \BbbN \) has characteristic zero, most notably the ring of integers \( \BbbZ \) and the fields \( \BbbQ \), \( \BbbR \), \( \BbbC \).

    \thmitem{ex:semiring_characteristic/integers_modulo} The ring \hyperref[def:ring_of_integers_modulo]{\( \BbbZ_n \)} of integers modulo \( n \) has characteristic \( \op{char}(\BbbZ_n) = n \) because of \fullref{thm:integers_modulo_isomorphic_to_quotient_group}.

    \thmitem{ex:semiring_characteristic/polynomial_ring} An \hyperref[def:algebra_over_ring]{algebra} \( A \) over a nontrivial commutative unital ring \( R \) has characteristic \( \op{char}(A) = R \) because of the canonical embedding of \( R \) in \( A \). In particular, polynomial \hyperref[def:algebra_of_polynomials]{rings} \( R[X] \) have the same characteristic as their ring.

    \thmitem{ex:semiring_characteristic/galois_fields} The \hyperref[thm:galois_field_existence]{Galois field} \( \BbbF_{p^n} \) has characteristic \( p \) because it is a field extension of \( \BbbF_p \).
  \end{thmenum}
\end{example}

\begin{proposition}\label{thm:category_of_semirings_properties}
  The \hyperref[def:semiring/category]{category of semirings} has the following properties:
  \begin{thmenum}
    \thmitem{thm:category_of_semirings_properties/initial} The \hyperref[def:set_of_integers]{ring of integers} \( \BbbZ \) is an \hyperref[def:universal_objects/initial]{initial object}.

    \thmitem{thm:category_of_semirings_properties/terminal} The trivial semiring \( \set{ 0 } \) is an \hyperref[def:universal_objects/terminal]{terminal object}.
  \end{thmenum}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  \SubProofOf{thm:category_of_semirings_properties/initial} Follows from \fullref{thm:semiring_characteristic_homomorphism}.
  \SubProofOf{thm:category_of_semirings_properties/terminal} Follows from \fullref{ex:def:semiring/trivial}.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}\label{def:semiring_division}\mimprovised
  Fix an arbitrary element \( x \) in a \hyperref[def:semiring]{semiring} \( R \). If, for some nonzero element \( y \), there exists a pair \( l \) and \( r \) of nonzero elements such that \( l y = y r = x \), we say that \( y \) is a \term{divisor} of \( x \) and that \( x \) is a \term{multiple} or \term{factor} of \( y \). We denote this by \( y \mid x \). Divisors of \( 1 \) are sometimes called \term{units}.

  The requirement that \( y \), \( l \) and \( r \) are nonzero is essential. Zero divisors are extensively studied, and without this requirement, every element of \( R \) would be a zero divisor due to \hyperref[def:semiring/absorption]{absorption}. Since \( 0 \) does not divide any nonzero element, we do not lose anything useful with this restriction.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}\label{thm:semiring_cancellative_iff_no_zero_divisors}
  An element of a commutative ring is a \hyperref[def:semiring_division]{zero divisor} if and only if it is not cancellable. That is, \( x \mid 0 \) if and only if \( xy = xz \) does not imply \( y = z \).
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Let \( x \) be a nonzero element.

  \SufficiencySubProof Suppose that \( x \) is a zero divisor and let \( y \) be such that \( xy = 0 \). For any element \( z \), we have
  \begin{equation*}
    xy = 0 = x(yz).
  \end{equation*}

  But \( y \neq yz \) unless \( z = 1 \). Thus, \( x \) is not cancellable.

  \NecessitySubProof Suppose that \( x \) is cancellable.

  Suppose also that \( xy = 0 \) for some nonzero \( y \). Then \( xy = x0 \), which implies \( y = 0 \). But this contradicts out choice of \( y \).

  Thus, \( x \) is not a zero divisor.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}\label{def:ordered_semiring}
  An \term{ordered semiring} is a semiring \( R \) with a \hyperref[def:partially_ordered_set]{partial order} \( \leq \) such that \( (R, +) \) is a \hyperref[def:ordered_magma]{ordered magma} and, additionally, \( 0 \leq x \) and \( 0 \leq y \) implies \( 0 \leq xy \).
\end{definition}

\begin{example}\label{ex:def:ordered_semiring}
  We list several examples of \hyperref[def:ordered_semirings]{ordered semirings}.

  \begin{thmenum}
    \thmitem{ex:def:ordered_semiring/natural_numbers} The \hyperref[def:set_of_natural_numbers]{natural numbers} form an ordered semiring as a consequence of \fullref{thm:natural_numbers_are_well_ordered}.
  \end{thmenum}
\end{example}
