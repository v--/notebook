\subsection{Semirings}\label{subsec:semirings}

We will start by defining semirings, and to do that we will first motivate distributivity.

\begin{proposition}\label{thm:monoid_distributivity}
  Fix an \hyperref[rem:additive_magma/multiplication]{additive} \hyperref[def:monoid]{monoid} \( (R, +, \cdot) \), where \( +: R \times R \to R \) is the monoid operation and \( \cdot: \BbbN \times R \to R \) is defined via \eqref{eq:rem:additive_magma/multiplication}.

  We have the following property, which we call \term{distributivity} of \( \cdot \) over \( + \):
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:thm:monoid_distributivity}
    n \cdot (x + y) = n \cdot x + n \cdot y.
  \end{equation}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  We use induction on \( n \). The case \( n = 0 \) is trivial. Suppose that \eqref{eq:thm:monoid_distributivity} holds. Then
  \begin{equation*}
    (n + 1) \cdot (x + y)
    \reloset {\eqref{eq:def:magma/exponentiation}} =
    n \cdot (x + y) + (x + y)
    \reloset {\T{ind.}} =
    n \cdot x + n \cdot y + (x + y)
    \reloset {\eqref{eq:def:magma/exponentiation}} =
    (n + 1) \cdot x + (n + 1) \cdot y.
  \end{equation*}
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}\label{def:semiring}\mcite[1]{Golan2010}
  A \term{semiring} is a \hyperref[def:magma/commutative]{commutative} \hyperref[def:monoid]{monoid} \( (R, +) \) with a second \hyperref[def:magma/associative]{associative} operation \( \cdot: R \times R \to R \) called \term{multiplication}, which extends multiplication with natural numbers. The precise compatibility axioms are listed in \fullref{def:semiring/theory} because they fit nicely into first-order logic (unlike the \hyperref[def:semimodule/theory]{theory of semimodules}, for example, for which we prefer expressing these conditions in the metalogic).

  Although not strictly necessary, it will be convenient for us to assume that multiplication has an identity. If a multiplicative identity does not exist, we call \( (R, +, \cdot) \) a \term{nonunital semiring}. A canonical example of a nonunital semiring is a \hyperref[def:semiring_ideal]{semiring ideal}. We will not use nonunital semirings, but it is important to acknowledge their existence. In this context, if an identity exists, we will sometimes call \( (R, + \cdot) \) a \term{unital semiring}.

  We call \( (R, +) \) the \term{additive monoid} and \( (R, \cdot) \) the \term{multiplicative monoid} of the semiring.

  Semirings have the following metamathematical properties:
  \begin{thmenum}
    \thmitem{def:semiring/theory} The \hyperref[def:first_order_theory]{first-order theory} for semirings extends the \hyperref[def:monoid/theory]{theory of monoids}.

    First, we add another \hyperref[rem:first_order_formula_conventions/infix]{infix} binary functional symbol \( \cdot \) and a constant \( 1 \). The notation for the constant is justified by \fullref{thm:semiring_characteristic_homomorphism}.

    We then extend the theory of monoids with \hyperref[def:magma/commutative]{commutativity} for \( + \), \hyperref[def:magma/associative]{associativity} for \( \cdot \), and the following axioms:
    \begin{thmenum}
      \thmitem{def:semiring/left_distributivity} Multiplication on the left distributes over addition:
      \begin{equation}\label{eq:def:semiring/left_distributivity}
        \xi \cdot (\eta + \zeta) \doteq \xi \cdot \eta + \xi \cdot \zeta.
      \end{equation}

      \thmitem{def:semiring/right_distributivity} Multiplication on the right also distributes over addition:
      \begin{equation}\label{eq:def:semiring/right_distributivity}
        (\xi + \eta) \cdot \zeta \doteq \xi \cdot \zeta + \eta \cdot \zeta.
      \end{equation}

      If multiplication is commutative, right distributivity follows from left distributivity.

      \thmitem{def:semiring/absorption} Zero is an absorbing element:
      \begin{equation}\label{eq:def:semiring/absorption}
        \xi \cdot 0 \doteq 0 \wedge 0 \cdot \xi \doteq 0.
      \end{equation}

      \thmitem{def:semiring/identity} We also restate the identity axiom \eqref{eq:def:monoid/theory/identity} for the multiplicative unit \( 1 \) to highlight its connection with \eqref{eq:def:semiring/absorption}:
      \begin{equation}\label{eq:def:semiring/identity}
        \xi \cdot 1 \doteq \xi \wedge 1 \cdot \xi \doteq \xi.
      \end{equation}
    \end{thmenum}

    \thmitem{def:semiring/homomorphism} A \hyperref[def:first_order_homomorphism]{first-order homomorphism} from the semiring \( R \) to \( S \) is a function \( \varphi: R \to S \) that is a \hyperref[def:monoid/homomorphism]{monoid homomorphism} both for their additive monoids also for their multiplicative monoids.

    \thmitem{def:semiring/submodel} The set \( A \subseteq R \) is a \hyperref[thm:substructure_is_model]{submodel} of \( R \) if it is a both \hyperref[def:monoid/submodel]{submonoid} of the additive monoid and also of the multiplicative monoid. We call \( A \) a \term{sub-semiring}.

    As a consequence of \fullref{thm:positive_formulas_preserved_under_homomorphism}, the \hyperref[def:multi_valued_function/image]{image} of a homomorphism \( \varphi: R \to S \) is a sub-semiring of \( A \).

    For an arbitrary set \( A \), we denote the \hyperref[def:first_order_generated_substructure]{generated submodel} by \( \braket{ A } \).

    \thmitem{def:semiring/trivial} The \hyperref[thm:substructures_form_complete_lattice/bottom]{trivial} semiring is the \hyperref[def:pointed_set/trivial]{trivial pointed set} \( \set{ 0 } \).

    See \fullref{ex:def:semiring/trivial} for some properties of the trivial semiring.

    \thmitem{def:semiring/exponentiation} As we shall see in \fullref{thm:semiring_characteristic_homomorphism}, multiplication in \( \cdot \) extends left multiplication with natural numbers in the monoid \( (R, +) \). We do have a third operation, however --- \hyperref[def:monoid/exponentiation]{monoid exponentiation} in \( (R, \cdot) \).

    For any integer \( n \), we have the fundamental property \( 1^n = 1 \).

    \thmitem{def:semiring/commutative} If multiplication is commutative, we call the semiring itself \term{commutative}. Unless multiplication corresponds to function composition, most semirings we will encounter will be commutative.

    Notable exceptions to this rule are \hyperref[def:ordinal]{ordinals}. A \hyperref[def:successor_and_limit_ordinal]{limit ordinal} \( \alpha \), regarded as the set of all smaller ordinals, is a semiring. It is not commutative, however, as shown in \fullref{ex:ordinal_addition}.

    \thmitem{def:semiring/power_set} Similarly to power set magmas defined in \fullref{def:magma/power_set}, the power set \( \pow(R) \) of a semiring is also a semiring with the operations
    \begin{align*}
      A \oplus B &\coloneqq \set{ x + y \given x \in A \T{and} y \in B } \\
      A \odot B  &\coloneqq \set{ x \cdot y \given x \in A \T{and} y \in B }
    \end{align*}

    \thmitem{def:semiring/category} The corresponding \hyperref[def:category_of_small_first_order_models]{category of \( \mscrU \)-small models} \( \ucat{SRing} \) is \hyperref[def:concrete_category]{concrete} over \hyperref[def:monoid]{\( \ucat{CMon} \)} with the forgetful functor taking the additive monoids. We denote the category of commutative semirings by \( \cat{CSRing} \).

    \thmitem{def:semiring/opposite}\mcite[555]{Knapp2016BasicAlgebra} The \term{opposite semiring} of \( (R, +, \cdot) \) is the semiring \( (R, +, \star) \), with multiplication defined as \( x \star y = y \cdot x \).
  \end{thmenum}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}\label{ex:def:semiring}
  We list several examples of \hyperref[def:semiring]{semirings} that are not \hyperref[def:ring]{rings}.

  \begin{thmenum}
    \thmitem{ex:def:semiring/trivial} A \hyperref[def:semiring/homomorphism]{semiring} is trivial if and only if \( 0_R = 1_R \). This follows from \eqref{eq:def:semiring/absorption} and \eqref{eq:def:semiring/identity}.

    As a consequence, if \( \varphi: \set{ 0 } \to R \) is a \hyperref[def:semiring/homomorphism]{semiring} homomorphism, \( R \) is a trivial semiring. This is further strengthened by \fullref{thm:semiring_embedding_preserves_characterstic}.

    \thmitem{ex:def:semiring/natural_numbers} The \hyperref[def:set_of_natural_numbers]{natural numbers} are the quintessential example of a semiring. We prove in \fullref{thm:natural_number_multiplication_properties} that they are a semiring.

    \thmitem{ex:def:semiring/ordinals} Every \hyperref[def:successor_and_limit_ordinal]{limit ordinal} is a monoid under addition, as discussed in \fullref{ex:def:semiring/ordinals}, however it is not commutative.

    \hyperref[def:cardinal_arithmetic/addition]{Cardinal addition} is commutative, however, and hence for every \hyperref[def:successor_and_limit_cardinal/weak_limit]{limit cardinal} \( \kappa \), the set of all cardinals smaller than \( \kappa \) are a semiring.

    \thmitem{ex:def:semiring/lattice} We discussed in \fullref{ex:def:monoid/semilattice} that in a \hyperref[def:semilattice/bounded]{bounded lattice} \( (X, \vee, \wedge, \top, \bot) \), both \( (X, \vee, \bot) \) and \( (X, \wedge, \top) \) are monoids.

    As a consequence of \fullref{thm:bounded_lattice_absorbing}, \( \bot \) is absorbing with respect to \( \wedge \) and \( \top \) with respect to \( \vee \). Therefore, if the lattice is \hyperref[def:semilattice/distributive_lattice]{distributive}, as a consequence of \fullref{thm:bounded_lattice_absorbing}, both \( (X, \vee, \wedge) \) and \( (X, \wedge, \vee) \) are semirings.

    We refer to these semirings are the positive and negative semiring of the lattice. This terminology comes from \fullref{ex:def:ordered_semiring/lattice}.

    \thmitem{ex:def:semiring/tropical}\mcite[exmpl. 1.12]{Golan2010} We consider again the set of natural numbers \( \BbbN \), but this time endowed with different operations. The construction requires adjoining a new element \( \infty \) to \( \BbbN \). We choose this to be the smallest infinite cardinal \hyperref[def:aleph_hierarchy]{\( \aleph_0 \)} because \hyperref[def:cardinal_arithmetic/addition]{cardinal addition} is a well-defined operation that suits our needs.

    The \term{tropical semiring} is the triple \( (\BbbN \cup \set{ \infty }, \min, +) \). The \hyperref[def:partially_ordered_set_extremal_points/maximum_and_minimum]{minimum} \( \min \) as a binary operation plays the role of semiring addition, with \( \infty \) as the identity. Cardinal addition plays the role of semiring multiplication, with \( 0 \) as the identity.

    \hyperref[def:semiring/left_distributivity]{Distributivity} is satisfied because
    \begin{equation*}
      \min\set{ x, y } + z = \min\set{ x + z , y + z }.
    \end{equation*}

    \hyperref[def:semiring/absorption]{Absorption} is satisfied because \( x + \infty = \infty \) by \fullref{thm:simplified_cardinal_arithmetic/infinite}.
  \end{thmenum}
\end{example}

\begin{proposition}\label{thm:semiring_characteristic_homomorphism}
  For every \hyperref[def:semiring/identity]{semiring}, multiplication extends the abelian group multiplication.

  More precisely, denote the additive identity by \( 0_R \) and the multiplicative identity by \( 1_R \). Define the following semiring homomorphism:
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:thm:semiring_characteristic_homomorphism}
    \begin{aligned}
      &\iota: \BbbN \to R \\
      &\iota(n) \coloneqq \begin{cases}
        0_R                &n = 0, \\
        \iota(n - 1) + 1_R &n > 0.
      \end{cases}
    \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}

  This is the unique homomorphism from \( \BbbN \) to \( R \). Furthermore, we have the following analogue to \eqref{eq:def:magma/exponentiation}:
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:thm:semiring_characteristic_homomorphism/multiplication}
    \iota(n) \cdot x \coloneqq \begin{cases}
      0_R,                      &n = 0, \\
      \iota(n - 1) \cdot x + x, &n > 1.
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  First note that \eqref{eq:thm:semiring_characteristic_homomorphism/multiplication} follows from \eqref{eq:thm:semiring_characteristic_homomorphism} via \hyperref[def:semiring/right_distributivity]{right distributivity}.

  It remains to show that \( \iota \) is a monoid homomorphism, and that it is unique. Clearly \( \iota(0) = 0_R \) and \( \iota(1) = 1_R \). Proving \( \iota(n + m) = \iota(n) + \iota(m) \) and \( \iota(nm) = \iota(n) \cdot \iota(m) \) can be done via nested induction.

  Now suppose \( \varphi: \BbbN \to R \) is a homomorphism. It is clear that \( \varphi(0) = 0_R \) and \( \varphi(1) = 1_R \), and also
  \begin{equation*}
    \varphi(n + 1) = \varphi(n) + \varphi(1) = \varphi(n) + 1_R.
  \end{equation*}

  This implies \( \iota = \varphi \).
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}\label{def:semiring_characteristic}\mimprovised
  We define the \term{characteristic} \( \op{char}(R) \) of a semiring \( R \) via the following equivalent definitions:
  \begin{thmenum}
    \thmitem{def:semiring_characteristic/homomorphism} \( \op{char}(R) \) is the nonnegative integer \( n \) such that
    \begin{equation*}
      n \BbbZ = \ker\iota,
    \end{equation*}
    where \( \iota \) is the homomorphism from the natural numbers defined via \eqref{eq:thm:semiring_characteristic_homomorphism}.

    \thmitem{def:semiring_characteristic/direct} \( \op{char}(R) \) is the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( n \cdot 1_R = 0_R \) and \( \op{char}(R) = 0 \) if \( 0_R \) cannot be obtained in this way.
  \end{thmenum}
\end{definition}
\begin{defproof}
  \EquivalenceSubProof{def:semiring_characteristic/homomorphism}{def:semiring_characteristic/direct} Let \( n \) be such that
  \begin{equation*}
    n \BbbZ = \ker\iota.
  \end{equation*}

  In particular, \( \iota(0) = \iota(n) \).

  If \( n = 0 \), \( \ker\iota \) is a trivial group and \( \iota \) is an embedding. Then there cannot exist a positive integer \( n \) such that
  \begin{equation*}
    n \cdot 1_R = 0_R.
  \end{equation*}

  Otherwise, \( n \) is the smallest positive integer such that
  \begin{equation*}
    n \cdot 1_R = 0 \cdot 1_R = 0_R.
  \end{equation*}
\end{defproof}

\begin{proposition}\label{thm:semiring_embedding_preserves_characterstic}
  If \( \varphi: R \to T \) is a \hyperref[def:semiring/homomorphism]{semiring embedding}, then the \hyperref[def:semiring_characteristic]{characteristic} of \( R \) is equal to that of \( T \).
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  First suppose that \( R \) has positive characteristic \( n \). Then \( n \cdot 1_R = 0_R \), which implies \( n \cdot \varphi(1_R) = \varphi(0_R) \), hence \( \op{char}(T) \leq n \). But \( \varphi \) is an embedding, hence if \( k \cdot 1_R \neq 0_R \), then
  \begin{equation*}
    k \cdot \varphi(1_R) \neq \varphi(0_R).
  \end{equation*}

  This implies that \( \op{char}(T) \geq \op{char}(R) \), which in turn shows that \( \op{char}(T) = \op{char}(R) \).

  If \( R \) has characteristic zero, then \( \iota: \BbbN \to R \) is an embedding and thus \( \varphi \bincirc \iota: \BbbN \to T \) is also an embedding. It is unique as shown in \fullref{thm:semiring_characteristic_homomorphism}. Therefore, \( T \) also has characteristic zero.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}\label{ex:semiring_characteristic}
  The following are examples of \hyperref[def:semiring_characteristic]{semiring characteristics}:

  \begin{thmenum}
    \thmitem{ex:semiring_characteristic/nonnegative_integers} The zero-based \hyperref[def:set_of_natural_numbers]{natural numbers} \( \BbbN \) have characteristic \( \op{char}(\BbbN) = 0 \) because \( \iota \) is an isomorphism. Consequently, by \fullref{thm:semiring_embedding_preserves_characterstic}, any super-semiring of \( \BbbN \) has characteristic zero, most notably the ring of integers \( \BbbZ \) and the fields \( \BbbQ \), \( \BbbR \), \( \BbbC \).

    \thmitem{ex:semiring_characteristic/integers_modulo} The ring \hyperref[thm:ring_of_integers_modulo]{\( \BbbZ_n \)} of integers modulo \( n \) has characteristic \( \op{char}(\BbbZ_n) = n \) because of \fullref{thm:integers_modulo_isomorphic_to_quotient_group}.

    \thmitem{ex:semiring_characteristic/polynomial_ring} An \hyperref[def:algebra_over_semiring]{algebra} \( A \) over a nontrivial commutative unital ring \( R \) has the same characteristic as \( R \) because of the canonical embedding of \( R \) in \( A \). In particular, polynomial \hyperref[def:algebra_of_polynomials]{rings} \( R[X] \) have the same characteristic as their ring.
  \end{thmenum}
\end{example}

\begin{proposition}\label{thm:category_of_semirings_properties}
  The \hyperref[def:semiring/category]{category of semirings} has the following basic properties:
  \begin{thmenum}
    \thmitem{thm:category_of_semirings_properties/initial} The \hyperref[def:set_of_integers]{ring of integers} \( \BbbZ \) is an \hyperref[def:universal_objects/initial]{initial object}.

    \thmitem{thm:category_of_semirings_properties/terminal} The trivial semiring \( \set{ 0 } \) is an \hyperref[def:universal_objects/terminal]{terminal object}.
  \end{thmenum}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  \SubProofOf{thm:category_of_semirings_properties/initial} Follows from \fullref{thm:semiring_characteristic_homomorphism}.
  \SubProofOf{thm:category_of_semirings_properties/terminal} Follows from \fullref{ex:def:semiring/trivial}.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}\label{def:ordered_semiring}\mcite[224]{Golan2010}
  An \term{ordered semiring} is a \hyperref[def:magma/commutative]{commutative} semiring \( R \) with a \hyperref[def:partially_ordered_set]{partial order} \( \leq \) such that \( (R, +) \) is an \hyperref[def:ordered_magma]{ordered magma} and, additionally, \( x \leq y \) and \( 0 \leq z \) imply \( xz \leq yz \).

  As in \fullref{def:ordered_magma}, the commutativity condition can be avoided, but then we would need to also require \( zx \leq zy \).

  In any semiring, we can use the usual terminology that is conventional for real numbers:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \( x \) is \term{positive} if \( x > 0 \).
    \item \( x \) is \term{nonnegative} if \( x \geq 0 \).
    \item \( x \) is \term{negative} if \( x < 0 \).
    \item \( x \) is \term{nonpositive} if \( x \leq 0 \).
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}\label{ex:def:ordered_semiring}
  We list several examples of \hyperref[def:ordered_semirings]{ordered semirings}.

  \begin{thmenum}
    \thmitem{ex:def:ordered_semiring/natural_numbers} The \hyperref[def:set_of_natural_numbers]{natural numbers} form an ordered semiring as shown in \fullref{thm:natural_numbers_are_well_ordered}.

    \thmitem{ex:def:ordered_semiring/lattice} We discussed in \fullref{ex:def:semiring/lattice} that a \hyperref[def:semilattice/bounded]{bounded} \hyperref[def:semilattice/distributive_lattice]{distributive} \hyperref[def:semilattice/lattice]{lattice} \( (X, \vee, \wedge) \) can be regarded as a semiring, and so can its opposite lattice.

    We discussed in \fullref{ex:def:ordered_magma/semilattice} that both \( (X, \vee) \) and \( (X, \wedge) \) are \hyperref[def:ordered_magma]{ordered magmas}. Both \( (X, \vee, \wedge) \) and \( (X, \wedge, \vee) \) vacuously satisfy the condition from \fullref{def:ordered_semiring}, which makes them ordered semirings.

    All elements of the ordered semiring \( (X, \vee, \wedge) \) are nonnegative and all elements of \( (X, \wedge, \vee) \) are nonpositive. With a slight abuse of notation, we refer to them as the \term{positive} and \term{negative} semirings of the lattice.
  \end{thmenum}
\end{example}

\begin{definition}\label{def:divisibility}\mimprovised
  Fix an arbitrary element \( x \) in a \hyperref[def:semiring/commutative]{commutative semiring}. If, there exist nonzero elements \( y \) and \( z \) such that \( x = yz \), we say that \( y \) and \( z \) are \term{divisors} of \( x \) and that \( x \) is a \term{multiple} or \term{factor} of \( y \) and of \( z \). We denote this by \( y \mid x \).

  As discussed in \fullref{rem:units_in_rings_etymology}, divisors of \( 1 \) are sometimes called \term{units}.

  The requirement that \( y \) and \( z \) are nonzero is essential. Zero divisors are extensively studied, and without this requirement, every element of \( R \) would be a zero divisor due to \hyperref[def:semiring/absorption]{absorption}. Since \( 0 \) does not divide any nonzero element, we do not lose anything useful with this restriction.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}\label{thm:semiring_cancellative_iff_no_zero_divisors}
  An element of a \hyperref[def:semiring/commutative]{commutative semiring} is a \hyperref[def:divisibility]{zero divisor} if and only if it is not cancellable. That is, \( x \mid 0 \) if and only if \( xy = xz \) does not imply \( y = z \).
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Let \( x \) be a nonzero element.

  \SufficiencySubProof Suppose that \( x \) is a zero divisor and let \( y \) be such that \( xy = 0 \). For any element \( z \), we have
  \begin{equation*}
    xy = 0 = x(yz).
  \end{equation*}

  But \( y \neq yz \) unless \( z = 1 \). Thus, \( x \) is not cancellable.

  \NecessitySubProof Suppose that \( x \) is cancellable.

  Suppose also that \( xy = 0 \) for some nonzero \( y \). Then \( xy = x0 \), which implies \( y = 0 \). But this contradicts out choice of \( y \).

  Thus, \( x \) is not a zero divisor.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{thm:semiring_divisibility_order}
  In a \hyperref[def:semiring/commutative]{commutative semiring} without \hyperref[def:divisibility]{zero divisors}, the \hyperref[def:divisibility]{divisibility} relation is a \hyperref[def:preordered_set]{preorder}.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Fix a semiring \( R \).

  \SubProofOf[def:binary_relation/reflexive]{reflexivity} Clearly every element of \( R \) divides itself.

  \SubProofOf[def:binary_relation/transitive]{transitivity} Let \( x \mid y \mid z \). Then there exist elements \( a \) and \( b \) such that \( y = a x \) and \( z = b y \). Hence, \( z = (ba) x \) and \( x \mid z \).
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}\label{def:gcd_lcm}\mimprovised
  Fix a \hyperref[def:semiring/commutative]{commutative semiring} \( R \) without \hyperref[def:divisibility]{zero divisors}. Define the equivalence relation \( x \sim y \) to hold if \( x \mid y \) and \( y \mid x \). By \fullref{thm:preorder_to_partial_order}, the quotient set \( R / {\sim} \) is now a \hyperref[def:partially_ordered_set]{partially ordered set}. We will use this quotient in order to avoid the nonuniqueness problems described in \fullref{ex:preorder_nonuniqueness}.

  If \( [z] \) is the \hyperref[def:partially_ordered_set_extremal_points/supremum_and_infimum]{supremum} of the cosets \( [x] \) and \( [y] \), we say that \( z \) is a \term{least common multiple} of \( x \) and \( y \). If the coset \( [z] \) has some canonical representative, we use the notation \( \lcm(x, y) \).

  \hyperref[thm:categorical_principle_of_duality]{Dually}, if \( [z] \) is the \hyperref[def:partially_ordered_set_extremal_points/supremum_and_infimum]{infimum} of \( [x] \) and \( [y] \), we say that \( z \) is a \term{greatest common divisor} of \( x \) and \( y \). If the coset \( [z] \) has some canonical representative, we use the notation \( \gcd(x, y) \).
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}\label{thm:natural_number_divisibility_order}
  The set \hyperref[def:set_of_natural_numbers]{\( \BbbN \)} of natural numbers is a \hyperref[def:semilattice]{lattice} with respect to \hyperref[def:divisibility]{semiring divisibility}.

  The lattice has a \hyperref[def:partially_ordered_set_extremal_points/top_and_bottom]{bottom} element \( 1 \). If we remove the restriction that divisors should be nonzero, then \( 0 \) is the \hyperref[def:partially_ordered_set_extremal_points/top_and_bottom]{top}, and the lattice is \hyperref[def:semilattice/bounded]{bounded}.

  Furthermore, divisibility is compatible with the standard ordering in the sense that \( n \mid m \) implies \( n \leq m \).

  By \fullref{thm:semiring_divisibility_order}, divisibility is a preorder.

  \SubProofOf[def:binary_relation/antisymmetric]{antisymmetry} If \( n \mid m \) and \( m \mid n \), there exist numbers \( a \) and \( b \) such that \( n = ay \) and \( m = bx \). Then \( n = abx \), and we can cancel \( n \) to obtain that \( ab = 1 \). But \( 1 \) is the only unit in \( \BbbN \), hence \( a = b = 1 \), and thus \( n = m \).

  \SubProofOf[def:semilattice/lattice]{lattice structure} By \fullref{alg:euclidean_algorithm}, every pair of integers has a positive greatest common divisor, and also a least common multiple.

  \SubProof{Proof that the order are compatible} If \( n \mid m \), then there exists a positive natural number \( a \) such that \( an = m \). We have
  \begin{equation*}
    an
    \reloset{\eqref{eq:def:peano_arithmetic/PA7}} =
    (a - 1)n + n
    =
    m.
  \end{equation*}

  Thus, by \eqref{eq:def:natural_number_ordering/predicate}, \( n \leq m \).
\end{proof}
