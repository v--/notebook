\subsection{Ordinals}\label{subsec:ordinals}

\begin{remark}\label{rem:ordinal_is_equivalence_class}
  Ordinal numbers are generalizations of \hyperref[def:set_of_natural_numbers]{natural numbers} that are used for indices of potentially infinite ordered sets. They are themselves defined as ordered sets, which may be confusing at first.

  More precisely, every ordinal is defined as a concrete representative of an isomorphism class of well-ordered sets (this is not really factorization because there is no set of all ordinals by \fullref{thm:burali_forti_paradox}). This does not seem very important but it will be in \fullref{subsec:cardinals}.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}\label{def:well_founded_relation}
  Let \( \prec \) be a \hyperref[def:binary_relation]{binary relation} on a set \( A \) (not necessarily satisfying any axioms).

  An \term{infinitely descending sequence} is a \hyperref[def:sequence]{sequence} \( \seq{ x_k }_{k=1}^\infty \) such that \( x_{k+1} \prec x_k \) for all \( k \in 1, 2, \ldots \). That is,
  \begin{equation*}
    \cdots \prec x_3 \prec x_2 \prec x_1.
  \end{equation*}

  The relation \( \prec \) is called \term{well-founded} if there exists no infinitely descending sequence.

  We cannot easily formulate the theory of well-founded relations as an extension of the first-order \hyperref[def:totally_ordered_set]{theory of totally ordered sets}. This is why we only study well-relations sets in the context of \logic{ZFC}.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}\label{thm:set_membership_is_well_founded}
  Set membership is \hyperref[def:well_founded_relation]{well-founded} in \logic{ZFC}. More precisely, given a set \( A \), if we regard \( \in \) as a binary relation between members of \( A \), then we would obtain that \( \in \) is a well-founded relation.

  This proposition generalizes \fullref{thm:simple_foundation_theorems}.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  The empty set is vacuously well-founded so suppose that \( A \) is nonempty. Suppose also that \( \in \) is not well-founded on \( A \). Then there exists an infinitely descending sequence \( \seq{ x_k }_{k=1}^\infty \subseteq A \) such that
  \begin{equation*}
    \cdots \in x_3 \in x_2 \in x_1.
  \end{equation*}

  Denote by \( B \) the set \( \set{ x_k \given k = 1, 2, \ldots } \). By the \hyperref[def:zfc/foundation]{axiom of foundation}, \( B \) contains a set \( C \) which is disjoint from \( B \).

  Clearly \( C \) coincides with at least one of \( x_1, x_2, \ldots \). Let \( C = x_{k_0} \). Since \( x_{k_0} \cap B = \varnothing \), then \( x_{k_0 + 1} \) is either not a member of \( x_{k_0} \) or of \( B \). But it is a member of both by our assumption that the sequence is infinitely descending.

  The obtained contradiction proves that \( \in \) is well-founded on \( A \).
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{thm:infinite_descent_partial_order}
  In a \hyperref[def:poset]{poset} \( (\mscrP, \leq) \), the strict relation \( < \) is \hyperref[def:well_founded_relation]{well-founded} if and only if every nonempty subset \( A \subseteq \mscrP \) has a \hyperref[def:poset_extremal_points/maximal_and_minimal_element]{minimal element}.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  \SufficiencySubProof Suppose that \( \leq \) is well-founded and let \( A \subseteq \mscrP \). Suppose that \( A \) has no minimal element.

  If \( A \) is finite, we cannot construct an infinitely descending sequence because of irreflexivity of \( < \). If \( A \) is infinite, then we can construct an infinitely descending sequence using well-founded recursion as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Let \( x_1 \) be any element of \( A \).
    \item Given \( x_k \), let \( x_{k+1} \) be any element of \( A \) such that \( x_{k+1} < x_k \). We know that such an element exists because \( x_k \) is not minimal in \( A \).
  \end{itemize}

  This construction contradicts the well-foundedness of  \( \leq \), hence \( A \) must have a minimal element.

  \NecessitySubProof Suppose that every subset of \( \mscrP \) has a minimal element. Suppose that there exists an infinitely descending sequence \( \seq{ x_k }_{k=1}^\infty \). Then the set \( \set{ x_k \given x \in \set{ 1, 2, \ldots } } \) has no minimal element, which contradicts our assumption. Hence no sequence in \( \mscrP \) is infinitely descending and \( < \) is well-founded.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}\label{def:transitive_set}
  A set \( A \) is \term{transitive} if any of the following equivalent conditions are satisfied:
  \begin{thmenum}
    \thmitem{def:transitive_set/membership} If \( x \in A \) and \( y \in x \), then \( y \in A \).
    \thmitem{def:transitive_set/inclusion} If \( x \in A \), then \( x \subseteq A \).
  \end{thmenum}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{def:well_ordered_set}\mcite[def. 63.1]{OpenLogicFull}
  A \hyperref[def:totally_ordered_set]{totally ordered set} \( (\mscrP, \leq) \) is said to be \term{well-ordered} if either of the following equivalent conditions hold:
  \begin{thmenum}
    \thmitem{def:well_ordered_set/direct} Every nonempty subset of \( \mscrP \) has a \hyperref[def:poset_extremal_points/maximum_and_minimum]{minimum}.
    \thmitem{def:well_ordered_set/well_founded} The order \( \leq \) is \hyperref[def:well_founded_relation]{well-founded}.
  \end{thmenum}
\end{definition}
\begin{proof}
  The equivalence follows from \fullref{thm:infinite_descent_partial_order} and \fullref{thm:totally_ordered_minimal_element_is_minimum}.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Well-founded induction]\label{thm:well_founded_induction}\mcite[prop. 63.3]{OpenLogicFull}
  Let \( \mscrL \) be the \hyperref[def:first_order_syntax]{first-order language} with no functional symbols and a single predicate symbol \( \prec \). We have already mentioned that we cannot formalize the concept of well-foundedness in first-order logic alone so we will work with \hyperref[def:first_order_structure]{structures} directly.

  Every \hyperref[def:well_founded]{well-founded} structure \( \mscrX = (X, I) \) over \( \mscrL \) satisfies an inductive axiom schema. For every formula \( \varphi \) over \( \mscrL \) not containing \( \eta \) nor \( \zeta \) as free variables, \( \mscrX \) satisfies
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:thm:well_founded_induction}
    \qforall \eta \parens[\Big]
      {
        \overbrace
          {
            \underbrace{ \qforall {\zeta \prec \eta} \varphi[\xi \mapsto \zeta] }_{\mathclap{\substack{\T{inductive} \\ \T{hypothesis}}}}
            \rightarrow
            \underbrace{ \varphi[\xi \mapsto \eta] }_{\mathclap{\substack{\T{inductive step} \\ \T{conclusion}}}}
          }^{\T{inductive step}}
      }
    \rightarrow
    \underbrace{ \qforall \eta \varphi[\xi \mapsto \eta] }_{\T{conclusion}}.
  \end{equation}

  See the comments in \fullref{def:peano_arithmetic/PA3} regarding variables and quantification in axiom schemas.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Fix a formula \( \varphi \) in \( \mscrL \). Fix a variable assignment \( v \) in \( \mscrX \). We will show that the \hyperref[def:material_implication/contrapositive]{contraposition} of \eqref{eq:thm:well_founded_induction} holds in this model.

  Suppose that there exists a value \( x \in X \) such that \( \varphi\Bracks{v_{\xi \mapsto x}} = F \). That is,
  \begin{equation*}
    \qexists \eta \neg \varphi[\xi \mapsto \eta].
  \end{equation*}
  holds.

  Let \( x_0 \) be the smallest such value (which is guaranteed to exist because \( X \) is well-founded by \( \prec \)). Thus the inductive hypothesis \( \qforall {\zeta < x_0} \varphi[\xi \mapsto \zeta] \) holds but the inductive step conclusion \( \varphi[\xi \mapsto x_0] \) does not.

  Since \( v \) was chosen arbitrarily, this is true for all variable assignments in \( \mscrX \). Formally,
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:thm:well_founded_induction/contraposition}
    \mscrX
    \vDash
    \qexists \eta \neg \varphi[\xi \mapsto \eta]
    \rightarrow
    \qexists \eta \parens[\Big]
      {
        \qforall {\zeta \prec \eta} \varphi[\xi \mapsto \zeta] \wedge \neg \varphi[\xi \mapsto \eta]
      }
  \end{equation}

  This is precisely the contrapositive of \eqref{eq:thm:well_founded_induction}. Since we are working in classical logic, the contrapositive is semantically equivalent to its original implication, hence \( \mscrX \vDash \eqref{eq:thm:well_founded_induction} \).
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[\( \varepsilon \)-induction]\label{thm:epsilon_induction}
  For every formula \( \varphi \) over \( \mscrL \) not containing \( \eta \) nor \( \zeta \) as free variables, the following is a theorem of \logic{ZFC}:
  \begin{equation}\label{thm:epsilon_induction}
    \qforall \eta \parens[\Big]
      {
        \overbrace
          {
            \underbrace{ \qforall {\zeta \in \eta} \varphi[\xi \mapsto \zeta] }_{\mathclap{\substack{\T{inductive} \\ \T{hypothesis}}}}
            \rightarrow
            \underbrace{ \varphi[\xi \mapsto \eta] }_{\mathclap{\substack{\T{inductive step} \\ \T{conclusion}}}}
          }^{\T{inductive step}}
      }
    \rightarrow
    \underbrace{ \qforall \eta \varphi[\xi \mapsto \eta] }_{\T{conclusion}}.
  \end{equation}

  This induction schema is called \enquote{\( \varepsilon \)-induction} because the set membership symbol \( \in \) is derived from \( \varepsilon \) as explained in \fullref{rem:epsilon_and_set_membership}.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  Every model of \logic{ZFC} is well-founded by \( \in \) as shown in \fullref{thm:set_membership_is_well_founded}. The corollary then follows from \fullref{thm:well_founded_induction}.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}\label{def:ordinal}\mcite[def. 63.12]{OpenLogicFull}
  A set is called an \term{ordinal} or an \term{ordinal number} if it is \hyperref[def:well_ordered_set]{well-ordered} under set membership.

  By tradition, ordinals are denoted by initial small Greek letters --- \( \alpha \), \( \beta \), \( \gamma \), \ldots --- however we often use \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) in logical formulas and so we prefer \( \gamma \) and \( \delta \).

  We use \( \gamma < \delta \) to mean \( \gamma \in \delta \). We denote by \( \cat{Ord} \) the \hyperref[thm:partial_order_category_correspondence]{poset category} induced by this relation.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}\label{thm:element_of_ordinal_is_ordinal}\mcite[lemma 63.13]{OpenLogicFull}
   Every element of an ordinal is an ordinal.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Let \( \delta \in \gamma \) where \( \gamma \) is an ordinal. We will show that \( \delta \) is an ordinal.

  Since \( \gamma \) is well-ordered by \( \in \), then any subset of \( \gamma \) has a minimal element. Because of the transitivity of \( \gamma \), \( \delta \) and any subset of \( \delta \) is also a subset of \( \gamma \) and hence has a minimum with respect to \( \in \). Hence \( \delta \) is well-ordered by \( \in \).

  To see that \( \delta \) is a transitive set, let \( A \in \delta \) and let \( x \in A \). Since \( \in \) is a well-order on \( \delta \), it is a transitive relation and hence if \( x \in A \in \delta \), we have \( x \in \delta \). Since \( x \) was chosen arbitrarily, we conclude that \( A \subseteq \delta \) and hence \( \delta \) is a transitive set.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Transfinite induction]\label{thm:transfinite_induction}\mcite[thm. 63.15]{OpenLogicFull}
  Denote by \( \op{isord} \) a formula in \hyperref[def:zfc]{\logic{ZFC}} with a single free variable \( \xi \) which is valid whenever \( \xi \) is an ordinal. Note that we cannot use the test \( \xi \in \cat{Ord} \) within the object language because it is not a member of the universe --- the domain of the category is a proper class by \fullref{thm:burali_forti_paradox}.

  For any formula \( \varphi \) in \logic{ZFC} and for every \( \xi \in \boldop{Free}(\varphi) \) the following formula is valid:
  \begin{multline}\label{eq:def:transfinite_induction}
    \qforall \eta \parens[\Big]
      {
        \op{isord}[\xi \mapsto \eta] \rightarrow
          \underbrace
            {
              \parens[\Big] { \qforall {\zeta \in \eta} \varphi[\xi \mapsto \zeta] }
            }_{\T{inductive hypothesis}}
        \rightarrow
        \overbrace{ \varphi[\xi \mapsto \eta] }^{\mathclap{\T{inductive step conclusion}}}
      }
    \rightarrow \\ \rightarrow
    \underbrace
      {
        \qforall \eta \parens[\Big] { \op{isord}[\xi \mapsto \eta] \rightarrow \varphi[\xi \mapsto \eta] }.
      }_{\T{conclusion}}
  \end{multline}

  In words, if we can prove that \( \varphi \) holds for any ordinal by assuming that it holds for all smaller ordinals, then we can conclude that \( \varphi \) holds simultaneously for all ordinals.

  Also note that this is not a special case of \fullref{thm:well_founded_induction} because there is no set of all ordinals due to \fullref{thm:burali_forti_paradox}.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  The proof is analogous to the proof of \fullref{thm:well_founded_induction} except that rather than taking elements of a fixed well-ordered set, we take ordinals.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:transfinite_recursion}
  \todo{Transfinite recursion}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proposition}\label{thm:ordinal_properties}
  \hyperref[def:ordinal]{Ordinals} have the following basic properties:
  \begin{thmenum}
    \thmitem{thm:ordinal_properties/empty_set} The empty set \( \varnothing \) is an ordinal.

    \thmitem{thm:ordinal_properties/trichotomy}\mcite[thm. 63.16]{OpenLogicFull} The order of ordinals is \hyperref[def:binary_relation/trichotomic]{trichotomic}. That is, if \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) are ordinals, either \( \alpha < \beta \), \( \beta > \alpha \) or \( \alpha = \beta \).

    \thmitem{thm:ordinal_properties/uniqueness} If two ordinal numbers are \hyperref[def:poset/homomorphism]{order-isomorphic}, they are equal.

    \thmitem{thm:ordinal_properties/descending_sequence_of_ordinals_is_finite}\mcite[prop. 63.20]{OpenLogicFull} Every strictly decreasing sequence of ordinals is finite.

    \thmitem{thm:ordinal_properties/set_of_ordinals_has_minimum} Every nonempty set of ordinals has a minimum.

    \thmitem{thm:ordinal_properties/set_of_smaller_ordinals} Any ordinal \( \alpha \) is equal to the set
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:thm:ordinal_properties/set_of_smaller_ordinals}
      \set{ \beta \in \cat{Ord} \given \beta < \alpha }
    \end{equation}
    of smaller than \( \alpha \) ordinals. As a consequence, this set is well-defined in \logic{ZFC}.

    \thmitem{thm:ordinal_properties/transitive_set_of_ordinals} The set \( A \) is an ordinal if and only if \( A \) is a transitive set of ordinals.
  \end{thmenum}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  \SubProofOf{thm:ordinal_properties/empty_set} This statement is vacuous since there are not elements nor subsets of \( \varnothing \).

  \SubProofOf{thm:ordinal_properties/trichotomy} Let \( \alpha_0 \) be an ordinal. We will first show that for any other ordinal \( \beta \), either \( \alpha_0 \in \beta \) or \( \beta \subseteq \alpha_0 \). We will use \fullref{thm:transfinite_induction} on \( \beta \).

  Fix an ordinal \( \beta_0 \). Since the inductive hypothesis holds for all \( \beta \in \beta_0 \), we have several possibilities:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If there exists a \( \beta \in \beta_0 \) such that \( \alpha_0 \in \beta \), then by the transitivity of the \( \in \) relation, we have \( \alpha_0 \in \beta_0 \).
    \item Otherwise, if \( \beta \subseteq \alpha_0 \) for \( \beta \in \beta_0 \), we have that \( \beta_0 \subseteq \alpha_0 \).
  \end{itemize}

  \Fullref{thm:transfinite_induction} allows us to conclude that either \( \alpha_0 \in \beta \) or \( \beta \subseteq \alpha_0 \) independent on the choice of the ordinal \( \beta \). Furthermore, since \( \alpha_0 \) was chosen arbitrarily, this conclusion does not depend on \( \alpha_0 \) and holds for any two ordinals.

  Thus if \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) are two ordinals, we have the following mutually exclusive possibilities:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \( \alpha \in \beta \)
    \item \( \beta \in \alpha \)
    \item Neither \( \alpha \in \beta \) nor \( \beta \in \alpha \), in which case by what we have just proved, both \( \alpha \subseteq \beta \) and \( \beta \subseteq \alpha \) hold. Therefore \( \alpha = \beta \).
  \end{itemize}

  This is the desired trichotomy.

  \SubProofOf{thm:ordinal_properties/uniqueness} Let \( \alpha \cong \beta \) be order-isomorphic ordinals. By \fullref{thm:ordinal_properties/trichotomy}, either \( \alpha \in \beta \) or \( \beta \in \alpha \) or \( \alpha = \beta \). To show that the first two cases are impossible, without loss of generality assume that \( \alpha \in \beta \). Let \( h: \alpha \to \beta \) be an embedding. We have that \( h(\alpha) = \beta \) and \( h(\alpha) \in \beta \), hence \( \beta \in \beta \). But this contradicts trichotomy because \( \beta = \beta \).

  Thus we conclude that \( \alpha = \beta \).

  \SubProofOf{thm:ordinal_properties/descending_sequence_of_ordinals_is_finite} Suppose that there exists an infinite sequence of ordinals \( \seq{ \alpha_k }_{k=1}^\infty \) such that \( \alpha_{k+1} \in \alpha_k \) for all \( k \in 1, 2, \ldots \). Thus \( \alpha_1 \) itself as a set has no minimal element with respect to \( \in \), which contradicts the definition of an ordinal.

  The obtained contradiction proves the result.

  \SubProofOf{thm:ordinal_properties/set_of_ordinals_has_minimum} Let \( A \) be a set of ordinals. By \fullref{thm:ordinal_properties/trichotomy}, this set is totally ordered by \( \in \).

  Suppose that a minimum does not exist. Let \( \alpha_1 \in A \). Since \( \alpha_1 \) is not a minimum, there exists \( \alpha_2 \in A \) such that \( \alpha_2 \in \alpha_1 \). We thus build a sequence \( \seq{ \alpha_k }_{k=1}^\infty \subseteq A \) such that \( \alpha_{k+1} \in \alpha_k \) for all \( k \in 1, 2, \ldots \). But this contradicts \fullref{thm:ordinal_properties/descending_sequence_of_ordinals_is_finite}.

  The obtained contradiction shows that \( A \) has a minimum.

  \SubProofOf{thm:ordinal_properties/set_of_smaller_ordinals} Fix an ordinal \( \alpha \). By \fullref{thm:element_of_ordinal_is_ordinal}, every element of \( \alpha \) is again an ordinal and by \fullref{thm:ordinal_properties/trichotomy} all ordinals smaller than \( \alpha \) are elements of \( \alpha \). Therefore \eqref{eq:thm:ordinal_properties/set_of_smaller_ordinals} can be reduced to the set \( \set{ \beta \given \beta \in \alpha } \), which obviously equals \( \alpha \).

  \SubProofOf{thm:ordinal_properties/transitive_set_of_ordinals} If \( A \) is an ordinal, by \fullref{thm:ordinal_properties/set_of_smaller_ordinals}, it is the set of all smaller ordinals. Since \( A \) is transitive by definition, it is a transitive set of ordinals.

  Conversely, suppose that \( A \) is a transitive set of ordinals. We must only show that it is well-ordered by \( \in \). Let \( B \subseteq A \) be a nonempty set. By \fullref{thm:ordinal_properties/set_of_ordinals_has_minimum}, \( B \) has a minimum with respect to \( \in \), hence \( A \) is well-ordered by \( \in \). Since \( A \) is a transitive set, it follows that \( A \) is an ordinal.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Burali-Forti paradox]\label{thm:burali_forti_paradox}\mcite[thm. 63.19]{OpenLogicFull}
  Assuming \logic{ZFC}, there is no set of all ordinals.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Aiming at a contradiction, suppose that \( A \) is a containing all ordinals. If \( \alpha \in A \) and \( \beta \in \alpha \), transitivity of \( \in \) implies that \( \beta \in A \) since \( \beta \) is again an ordinal by \fullref{thm:element_of_ordinal_is_ordinal}. Thus \( A \) is a transitive set of ordinals, which \fullref{thm:ordinal_properties/transitive_set_of_ordinals} is itself an ordinal. Hence \( A \in A \).

  But this contradicts \fullref{thm:zfc_existence_theorems/member_of_itself}. Hence there is no set of all ordinals.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{thm:order_type_existence}\mcite[thm. 63.25]{OpenLogicFull}
  Any \hyperref[def:well_ordered_set]{well-ordered set} \( (\mscrP, \leq) \) is \hyperref[def:poset/homomorphism]{order-isomorphic} to a unique ordinal. This ordinal is called the \term{order type} of \( (\mscrP, \leq) \) and is denoted by \( \ord(\mscrP) \).
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose that \( (\mscrP, \leq) \) is not isomorphic to any ordinal.

  If for at least one element \( x \in P \) the \hyperref[def:poset_interval/ray]{initial segment} \( \mscrP_{<x} \) of \( \mscrP \) is not isomorphic to any ordinal, denote the smallest such element by \( x_0 \) and denote \( \mscrQ \coloneqq \mscrP_{<x_0} \) end endow it with the induced by \( \leq \) order.

  Otherwise, let \( \mscrQ \coloneqq \mscrP \).

  Then any initial segment \( \mscrP_{<x} \) of \( \mscrQ \) is isomorphic to some ordinal \( \alpha_x \), which by \fullref{thm:ordinal_properties/uniqueness} is unique.

  By \hyperref[def:zfc/choice], the following set exists and is a function:
  \begin{equation*}
    f \coloneqq \set{ (\alpha_x, x) \given x \in Q }.
  \end{equation*}

  This is obviously an order isomorphism from \( \alpha \coloneqq \dom(f) \) to \( \mscrQ \).

  In order to show that the set \( \alpha \) is an ordinal, by \fullref{thm:ordinal_properties/transitive_set_of_ordinals} we must only show that it is transitive. Let \( \beta \in \alpha \) and \( \gamma \in \beta \). Then \( \gamma \in \alpha \) since it is the preimage under \( f \) of some element of \( \mscrQ \) smaller than \( f(\beta) \). Thus \( \alpha \) is a transitive set of ordinals and hence is itself an ordinal with \( f \) as the explicit isomorphism.

  Furthermore, if \( \alpha' \) is another ordinal that is isomorphic to \( \mscrQ \) with an explicit isomorphism \( g \), then \( g \circ f^{-1} \) is an isomorphism from \( \alpha' \) to \( \alpha \). But by \fullref{thm:ordinal_properties/uniqueness}, isomorphic ordinals are unique and hence \( \alpha = \alpha' \).
\end{proof}
