\section{Functional analysis}\label{sec:functional_analysis}

\Fullref{sec:real_analysis} and \fullref{sec:complex_analysis} study certain functions with values in \hyperref[thm:vector_space_dimension]{finite-dimensional} \hyperref[def:hilbert_space]{Hilbert spaces}. Functional analysis studies spaces of functions arising from real or complex analysis. These spaces are mostly infinite-dimensional, and a lot of results hold for general infinite-dimensional \hyperref[def:vector_space]{vector spaces}.

Nevertheless, we will only study vector spaces over \hyperref[def:real_numbers]{\( \BbbR \)} or \hyperref[def:complex_numbers]{\( \BbbC \)}. This is justified by \fullref{rem:real_field_extensions}. As in \fullref{sec:complex_analysis}, through this section, \( \BbbK \) will refer to either \( \BbbR \) or \( \BbbC \).
