\section{Geometry}\label{sec:geometry}

Geometry is the multi-millennium evolution of attempts to measure parts of the earth. Ironically, it may be the main historical justification for the gradual axiomatization of mathematics. Completely abstract results about shapes date at least as early as in Ancient Greece. The important distinction between ancient geometry and modern geometry is the introduction of coordinates in the 17th century.

An axiomatic approach for a theory of plane and, solid figures was developed by Euclid in the third century BC. Later, Hilbert, Tarski and others independently proposed axioms that fit the requirements of modern logic systems. This is known today as \term{synthetic Euclidean geometry} and is mostly of theoretical interest because modern tools are easier to work with.

Descartes' idea of coordinates connects problems of algebra and geometry in such a way that most of today's mathematics seamlessly switches between algebraic and geometric interpretations of the same problem. The study of classical Greek geometry in terms of coordinates is known as \term{analytic geometry}.
