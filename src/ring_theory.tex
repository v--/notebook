\section{Ring theory}\label{sec:ring_theory}

As discussed in \fullref{rem:additive_magma}, commutative and non-commutative groups are quite different despite having similar definitions. Rings are extensions of \hyperref[def:abelian_group]{abelian groups}, which allow multiplication with more than members of \( \BbbZ \).

For commutative rings, this second operation is often truly an extension of \fullref{def:magma/exponentiation} to arbitrary ring elements. For noncommutative ring, this second operation is usually given by function composition.

This section also describes \hyperref[def:module]{modules}, which are important both as generalizations of \hyperref[def:vector_space]{vector spaces} and as a tool to study rings. \hyperref[def:ring_ideal]{Ring ideals} are instances of submodules, for example.

In an attempt to encompass the \hyperref[def:natural_number]{natural numbers}, \hyperref[def:lattice_ideal]{lattice ideals} and \hyperref[def:polynomial_semiring]{polynomials} and \hyperref[def:array/matrix]{matrices} over \hyperref[def:tropical_semiring]{tropical semirings}, we have chosen to use \hyperref[def:semiring]{semirings}, \hyperref[def:semimodule]{semimodules} and \hyperref[def:semiring_ideal]{semiring ideals} as fundamental notions.
