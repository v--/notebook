\section{Ring theory}\label{sec:ring_theory}

As discussed in \fullref{rem:additive_magma}, commutative and non-commutative groups are quite different despite having similar definitions. Rings are extensions of \hyperref[def:abelian_group]{Abelian groups}, which allow multiplication with more than members of \( \BbbZ \).

For commutative rings, this second operation is often truly an extension of \fullref{def:magma/exponentiation} to arbitrary ring elements. For noncommutative ring, this second operation is usually given by function composition.
