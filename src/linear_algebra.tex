\section{Linear algebra}\label{sec:linear_algebra}

Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that is both very accessible and enormously useful. It studies \hyperref[def:vector_space]{vector spaces}, mostly over \hyperref[def:set_of_real_numbers]{real} or \hyperref[def:set_of_complex_numbers]{complex} numbers, and \hyperref[def:semimodule/homomorphism]{linear maps} between them. For \hyperref[def:vector_space_dimension]{finite-dimensional} vector spaces, this reduces to studying \hyperref[def:array/matrix]{matrices}, which also leads to a very rich computational theory.
