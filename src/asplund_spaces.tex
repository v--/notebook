\section{Asplund spaces}\label{sec:asplund_spaces}

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:asplund_space}
  The Banach space $X$ is called an Asplund (resp. weak Asplund) space if any of the following equivalent conditions hold:

  \begin{defenum}
    \item\cite[theorem 2.14]{Phelps1993} Every continuous convex function on a convex open subset $D$ of $X$ is Frechet (resp. Gateaux) differentiable at a dense $G_\delta$ subset of $D$.
    \item\cite[definition 5.2]{Phelps1993} The dual space $X^*$ has the Radon-Nikodym property.
    \item\cite[theorem 5.12]{Phelps1993} Every nonempty weak* compact convex subset of $X^*$ is the weak* closed convex hull of its weak* strongly exposed points.
  \end{defenum}
\end{definition}
