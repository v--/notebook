\section{Commutative algebra}\label{sec:commutative_algebra}

Commutative algebra generalizes desirable properties of \hyperref[def:set_of_integers]{set \( \BbbZ \) of integers} to nontrivial \hyperref[def:ring/commutative]{commutative unital rings}. As a result, this allows studying polynomials or even arbitrary functions via techniques similar to those for integers.

In this whole section, \( R \) will refer to a nontrivial commutative unital ring. Since \( R \) is commutative, left and right modules over \( R \) are equivalent. We will only refer to either of them as simply \enquote{modules}.
