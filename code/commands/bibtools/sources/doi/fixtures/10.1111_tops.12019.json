Significant results from our study were as follows: (a) there was substantial disagreement among mathematicians regarding whether the argument was a valid proof, (b) applied mathematicians were more likely than pure mathematicians to judge the argument valid, (c) participants who judged the argument invalid were more confident in their judgments than those who judged it valid, and (d) participants who judged the argument valid usually did not change their judgment when presented with a reason raised by other mathematicians for why the proof should be judged invalid. These findings suggest that, contrary to some claims in the literature, there is not a single standard of validity among contemporary mathematicians.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1111\/tops.12019","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2013,4,11]],"date-time":"2013-04-11T14:34:20Z","timestamp":1365690860000},"page":"270-282","update-policy":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":44,"title":"On Mathematicians' Different Standards When Evaluating Elementary Proofs","prefix":"10.1111","volume":"5","author":[{"given":"Matthew","family":"Inglis","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Mathematics Education Centre Loughborough University"}]},{"given":"Juan Pablo","family":"Mejia\u2010Ramos","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Graduate School of Education Rutgers University"}]},{"given":"Keith","family":"Weber","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Graduate School of Education Rutgers University"}]},{"given":"Lara","family":"Alcock","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Mathematics Education Centre Loughborough University"}]}],"member":"311","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2013,4,11]]},"reference":[{"key":"e_1_2_9_2_1","first-page":"61","volume-title":"Proofs and other dilemmas: Mathematics and philosophy","author":"Auslander J.","year":"2008"},{"key":"e_1_2_9_3_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1093\/philmat\/12.2.81"},{"key":"e_1_2_9_4_1","first-page":"9","volume-title":"Essays in the Foundations of Mathematics and Logic","author":"Azzoumi J.","year":"2005"},{"key":"e_1_2_9_5_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.2307\/2316620"},{"key":"e_1_2_9_6_1","volume-title":"The mathematical experience","author":"Davis P.
