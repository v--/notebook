\chapter{Linear algebra}\label{ch:linear_algebra}

Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that is both very accessible and enormously useful. It studies \hyperref[def:vector_space]{vector spaces}, mostly over \hyperref[def:real_numbers]{real} or \hyperref[def:complex_numbers]{complex} numbers, and \hyperref[def:linear_function]{linear maps} between them. For \hyperref[thm:vector_space_dimension]{finite-dimensional} vector spaces, this reduces to studying \hyperref[def:array/matrix]{matrices}, which also leads to a very rich computational theory.

We have discussed the basics of vector spaces in \fullref{sec:modules} in the context of general \hyperref[def:module]{modules over rings}. The key takeaways are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Vector spaces, defined incrementally in \cref{def:semimodule}, \cref{def:module} and \cref{def:vector_space}, with some properties listed in \cref{thm:def:vector_space}.
  \item Linear combinations, defined in \cref{def:free_semimodule} and characterized by \fullref{thm:free_semimodule_universal_property}, with important remarks in \cref{def:linear_combination}.
  \item Linear spans, defined in \cref{def:semimodule/submodel} and characterized via \cref{thm:span_via_linear_combinations}.
  \item Linear maps, defined in \cref{def:linear_function}, and multilinear maps, defined in \cref{def:multilinear_function}.
  \item Quotient spaces, discussed in \cref{def:module/quotient} for general modules.
  \item \Fullref{thm:quotient_structure_universal_property} and \Fullref{thm:lattice_theorem_for_submodules}.
  \item Linear (in)dependence, defined in \cref{def:linear_dependence} with some properties listed in \cref{thm:def:linear_dependence}.
  \item Hamel bases, defined in \cref{def:hamel_basis} and \cref{def:ordered_hamel_basis}, with some properties listed in \cref{thm:def:hamel_basis}.
  \item Basis decomposition defined in \cref{def:basis_decomposition}.
  \item Coordinate spaces, defined in \cref{def:coordinate_space}.
  \item Vector space dimensions, whose existence and uniqueness is shown in \cref{thm:vector_space_dimension}.
  \item \Fullref{thm:rank_nullity_theorem}.
\end{itemize}
