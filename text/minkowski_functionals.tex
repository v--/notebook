\subsection{Minkowski functionals}\label{subsec:minkowski_functionals}

\begin{definition}\label{def:minkowski_functional}
  Let \( A \) is an \hyperref[def:neighborhood_set_types/absorbing]{absorbing} \hyperref[def:convex_hull]{convex} set.

  We define the corresponding \term{Minkowski functional}
  \begin{balign*}
     & \rho_A: X \to [0, \infty),
     & \rho_A(x) = \inf \{ t > 0 \colon x \in tA \}.
  \end{balign*}
\end{definition}
\begin{proof}
  We will prove that \( \rho_A(x) \) is always a nonnegative real number. Obviously
  \begin{equation*}
    \rho_A(x) \geq 0
  \end{equation*}
  since the infimum over \( \BbbR_{>0} \) is \( 0 \).

  Now fix \( x \in X \). Since \( A \) is an absorbing set, there exists \( t_0 > 0 \) such that \( t_0 x \in A \). We need to take the infimum of all such numbers. This infimum exists since \( \BbbR \) is complete and the set over which we take the minimum is bounded.
\end{proof}
