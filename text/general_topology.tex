\section{General topology}\label{sec:general_topology}

Analysis and geometry which are mostly concerned with \hyperref[def:real_numbers]{real} \hyperref[def:vector_space]{vector spaces}. Topology is concerned with the bare necessities in which desirable properties of these spaces. General topology, also called point-set topology, allows studying \hyperref[def:topological_space]{topological spaces} via their individual points. This is in stark contrast with \fullref{sec:category_theory} and algebraic topology, which study topological spaces via \hyperref[def:global_continuity]{continuous functions}.
