\chapter{Complex analysis}\label{ch:complex_analysis}

Complex analysis an extension of \fullref{ch:real_analysis}, which is concerned with studying functions with values in \hyperref[thm:vector_space_dimension]{finite-dimensional} \hyperref[def:complex_numbers]{complex} \hyperref[def:hilbert_space]{Hilbert spaces} \( \BbbC^n \) rather than Euclidean spaces \( \BbbR^n \). A lot of results are different, however much of \fullref{ch:real_analysis} is delegated here because it holds in greater generality. For these general results, through the section, \( \BbbK \) will refer to either \( \BbbR \) or \( \BbbC \).

Despite complex analysis being a very rich field, we are mostly concerned with special functions, to which we dedicate the following sections:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \Fullref{sec:power_series}
  \item \Fullref{sec:trigonometric_functions}
  \item \Fullref{sec:exponential_function}
  \item \Fullref{sec:trigonometric_polynomials}
  \item \Fullref{sec:special_functions}
\end{itemize}
