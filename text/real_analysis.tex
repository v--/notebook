\chapter{Real analysis}\label{ch:real_analysis}

Real analysis is concerned with \hyperref[def:function]{functions} with values in \hyperref[def:euclidean_space]{Euclidean spaces}. These include the real line \( \BbbR \), plane \( \BbbR^2 \) or space \( \BbbR^3 \), which are the classic spaces from \fullref{sec:euclidean_plane}.

Important aspects of real analysis include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \hyperref[def:local_continuity]{Continuity}, which we discuss extensively in \fullref{ch:general_topology} and \fullref{ch:metric_spaces}, and aggregate in \fullref{sec:topology_of_euclidean_spaces} and \fullref{sec:real_convergence}.

  \item \hyperref[def:differentiability]{Differentiability}, which we discuss in \fullref{sec:differentiability} from \fullref{ch:functional_analysis} and discuss briefly in \fullref{sec:differentiability}, and, in a generalized form, in \fullref{sec:nonsmooth_derivatives}.

  \item Integration, which we discuss in \fullref{sec:riemann_integration}.

  \item Special functions, which we delegate to \fullref{ch:complex_analysis} via \fullref{sec:special_functions}.

  \item Convex functions, which we discuss in \fullref{sec:convex_functions}.
\end{itemize}
