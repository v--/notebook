\chapter{Dynamical systems}\label{ch:dynamical_systems}

Dynamical systems model phenomena evolving with time. We dedicate much of \fullref{sec:abstract_dynamical_systems} to the question about what a dynamical system is, and then used the established formalisms to study objects which can, in some favorable cases, be considered dynamical systems:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \Fullref{sec:cellular_automata}.
  \item \Fullref{sec:difference_equations}.
  \item \Fullref{sec:recurrence_relations}.
\end{itemize}
